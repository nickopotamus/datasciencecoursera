Initial efforts to lay blame upon the president -- who was betrayed by both the GSA director he had appointed and by the Secret Service and military personnel tasked to protect him in Cartagena -- were predictable enough. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, suggested that Obama is somehow “responsible” for overspending on a GSA conference in Las Vegas simply because he appointed the agency’s head (whom he promptly fired when the abuses came to his attention).

Grandstanding politicians like her often compare the nation’s expenditures, with false naivete, to a household budget. For a family earning $40,000 a year, this would represent a misallocation of far less than 4 cents.

My wife told me recently that she has lost feelings for me, and that it has been for several years. We rarely have sex (twice in the last year). I take care of myself, exercise regularly and have a good build. We have sought counseling before, though her feelings toward me didn't come up.

The filmmakers of Spielberg's generation wanted to take over Hollywood and change the face of an art form. And for a brief period, until the blockbuster syndrome kicked in in the mid-'70s, they did just that. Along with Lucas, Spielberg is often blamed for shutting down the renaissance, as if without "Jaws" and "Star Wars" it never would have occurred to anybody in Hollywood to come up with high concepts and saturation marketing. "I hate Spielberg," a young filmmaker told me at a movie festival recently when he heard I was going to be writing about him. "He killed the indie film." And then he added, "But I loved 'Jaws.' "

Hales: I'm not sure if the city can ensure that. But we can, with our planning, try to create the environment where it can happen.

The city's role is to make that possible -- to make it possible to have small venues in different parts of the community, support the community generated initiative that creates a new space.

* One of the highlights of opening night (for me) was seeing our Hall of Fame baseball writer, Rick Hummel, give the business to retired Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. It was all in fun, just the usual good-natured razzing that's part of the baseball culture. La Russa watched the game in the press box, and was into the game, writing down a lot of notes.

To raise $7 billion yearly and avoid further cuts to schools and services, the governor wants voters to increase taxes on the wealthy, and also increase the state's sales tax by a half-cent. But at least three other groups are eyeing the November ballot with possible initiatives to raise taxes or reform the tax system. Can the governor urge promoters of these tax measures to hold off  thereby increasing the chances that voters will approve his? Or will there be a mash-up of tax hikes on the ballot?
Over the weekend, I turned off my television. I couldn't take any more. I felt as if I had become part of a "Twilight Zone" episode.

Six months later, Desai’s father called. His friend was dead.
I’m not saying there’s a good time for Rutgers to venture into the heart of SEC country for a game, but if you had to choose at date, the week after the Razorbacks play defending BCS champion and bitter rival Alabama isn’t a bad one. For good measure, the week after Arkansas hosts Rutgers, they’ll face new SEC foe Texas A&M, and one week after that, powerhouse Auburn. So put it this way: The Scarlet Knights are not exactly the team the Razorbacks will have circled on the schedule.

As a woman, I couldn’t help but cringe as I watched. The episode was a stark reminder of how far we have -- and haven’t -- come as a society. As the 2012 GOP race pushes on, so too does the grind against women’s rights. There are the assaults on birth control and abortion and, in subtler ways, there are candidates like Mitt Romney, who evoke Ward Cleaver, an American dad of a sexist era.
"One district ... is more than 32,000 square miles," Murphy said. "Given the 26 percent cut legislators have already taken in salary and benefits, and the 15 percent additional cut the speaker made to the Assembly operating budget, today's action seems punitive, and not in line with the commission's duty to size legislative compensation to the job."
Palos Verdes won seven singles sets and did enough in doubles to defeat CdM on games, 79-70, after the teams tied with nine sets apiece. Palos Verdes (11-0), ranked No. 3 in the CIF Southern Section Division I coaches' poll, appears likely to take the No. 2 spot of CdM (13-3) when the new poll is released next week.
It is rare that someone gets paid whether or not they actually perform their promised duties or achieve promised outcomes. Yet, for some reason, we allow nursing homes to take our most frail and vulnerable under just such circumstances. And when their profits are threatened, we allow them to hold the safety and well-being of our citizens hostage.
"This legislation will streamline the permitting process and reduce the uncertainty in the permitting process," said Matthew Cohen, a street food consultant in San Francisco who organizes Off the Grid, gatherings of local food cart and truck vendors at various locations, including Fort Mason on Friday nights and the McCoppin stub off Valencia Street in the Mission District on Saturdays.

Of all the leaders of the past, one would think, surely we could agree that Lincoln is above reproach: Yet such an agreement would serve us poorly. No one questions his bona fides as a great man, as the Savior of the Union and the Redeemer President. DuBois was not quarreling with the enduring image of Lincoln. He was, rather, asking his readers -- and, by extension, history -- to note well and long remember that Lincoln was a man before he was a monument, and the story of a man who becomes a monument is more interesting and instructive than the story of a man who was born one.

As a rule, districts participating in schools of choice are to be commended and encouraged for expanding educational options.

As stupid as it sounds, this deficit financing is exactly what the United States has been doing for years. Democrats and Republicans can’t agree. Democrats want to increase taxes, while Republicans favor reduced spending. At this point, it may not matter. Our national debt is in excess of $14 trillion, and neither Democrats nor Republicans have the courage to make unpopular choices, so let’s cut out the drama and go bust right now. Maybe some of our creditors, such as China and Saudi Arabia, will bail us out, but don’t count on it.

A number of years earlier, my birthday present had been a trip to the Highlands with my brother. It was my first and soon-to-be-last visit there, and I had dreamed of riding their huge wooden monster of a coaster. I was 9 or 10 years old, but felt pretty grown-up to be there without my parents. That sensation lasted only a few minutes, because when we entered the line for the Comet, the park attendants told me I was too small to ride it. What?! I hadn't been prepared for that letdown.

Even for those who get that college degree, professional jobs are scarce.

But the state didn't follow through.
Factory activity weakened this spring, in part because of temporary factors. High gasoline prices forced consumers to spend less elsewhere, which cut demand for factory goods.

When we propose legislation, we have only foresight and cannot write perfect laws. One way or another, we'll err. The question we must ask as Americans is if we ought to err on the side of the individual or on the side of the government. I prefer to side with the individual over the groupthink of the government.

On the whole, I'd prefer our limited massacres to institutionalized mass killings, as despicable as they both are.

Talking to "Dream" creator/writer/director Roger Bean at the champagne cast party following the show I found that the musical has been playing in Los Angeles for a year and has won multiple Ovation Awards, LA Drama Critics Circle Awards and LA Weekly Awards. I also found out that before "Dream," Bean and producer David Elzer had collaborated on The Marvelous Wonderettes, a feel-good musical about a late '50s close-harmony girls group, which ran for two years at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood and had a brisk run at the Laguna Playhouse in the summer of 2008 before playing successfully off-Broadway. "Jukebox musicals have gotten a new respect with the likes of Rock of Ages, Smokey Joe's Café, and Jersey Boys, Bean said, "so I think we can compete with the best of 'em." The "Dream" production is still running in Los Angeles, so the two shows are running simultaneously. However, the Laguna Playhouse cast are the five original cast members.

Why does the present administration ignore the lessons history has taught us? Can it be its purpose isn't to help the economy but to push into voters' minds a false image of the GOP as obstructionists in a "do-nothing Congress" before the 2012 elections?

Gradual steps toward wider freedoms, including the appointment of moderates to some government ministries, have done little to appease civil rights advocates. They predict increased hostility toward reform when the king, who is in his 80s, dies. He is expected to be replaced by his half brother Prince Nayif ibn Abdulaziz, an ally of hard-line clerics and head of the Interior Ministry and its security networks that swiftly suppress protests, arrest accused witches and anyone deviating from the harsh interpretations of the Koran.
* The new NFL kickoff rules are absurdly bad. The other new rule requiring all scoring plays to be reviewed is equally inane. To clarify, a play has to be called a touchdown (or safety, etc.) on the field for it to be automatically reviewed. The reason Shurmur had to challenge Evan Moore's play in the end zone was because it was ruled "no catch" by the official on the field. Yet Moore's first touchdown -- which had no controversy whatsoever -- was revewed for almost 2 minutes. Dumb, dumb, dumb.

Trump wasted no chance to laud the ability of his 36-hole facility to host a major championship the size of the U.S. Open. About how unlike his other home club — Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, N.Y., which has hosted five Opens and a PGA Championship — it’s right off of a major artery (Route 78); how it has the on-site capability to park 18,000 cars; and room for nearly 100,000 spectators. About how each of its 18-hole layouts were what USGA executive director Mike Davis termed, “easily good enough” to host the Women’s Open.

Judges' comments: It is one thing to build an energy-efficient home; it's another to measure that efficiency through the seasons. By gathering this data, Meadowlark can tweak each home's efficiency and modify building practices for upcoming homes.
Honestly, were there any groundbreaking revelations? Of course it was disappointing that the Rangers marched into Comerica Park and took three out of four from the Tigers. But anybody who thinks four games in April will have any impact at all on what happens in October has clearly never watched any baseball before. The Tigers took two out of three from the Rangers last April at Comerica and finished 6-3 against them for the season. That didnt seem to help too much when the two teams met up in the ALCS, did it?

The concert, as it had on the second night in Moscow, demonstrated music director Riccardo Muti and his orchestra’s masterful feel for the ebb and flow, tension and release of Richard Strauss’s “Death and Transfiguration,” and Cesar Franck’s Symphony in D Minor swelled with romance and melodicism. Afterward, though, some of the musicians said they wished they’d had a chance to rehearse in this room beforehand as they had in the Moscow hall; they felt it took them a while to be able to hear one another properly and to reach the right balance.
Meet the forgotten housing crisis.

So did the news that general manager Rich Cho has a master plan. He told The Oregonian that he does have a plan, but declined to share it. It's the stuff of a secret-agent novel.

The Maywood Home for Soldiers' Widows at 224 N. First Ave. in the western suburb was built in 1924 to house the widows of Civil War soldiers. The classic brick structure would have a relatively small project size and prominent location that should make it the lynch pin for much-needed redevelopment in a historic suburb, the release said.

But he does hope Stadler and Jacobsen have some recollection of the kid they butted heads against in the Pacific-8 Conference. They went on to become two of the most recognizable faces in the game.

Other times it's a once-untried ingredient that comes out of nowhere to become ubiquitous. Several years ago, the it-dish was pork belly, but more recently pigs' ears are showing up with regularity on forward-thinking menus. Josef Centeno has them at the Lazy Ox Canteen, cut thick like steak fries and served with punchy aioli for dipping. Michael Voltaggio at Ink juliennes the fleshy flaps and showers the crisp curly ribbons on halved Brussels sprouts. under a thin transparent blanket of lardo. And at Pigg inside the new Umamicatessen downtown, Chris Cosentino plans to serve fries and crispy pig ears with "brainaise," i.e. aioli flavored with pig brains.

What a contrast. We have the handful of past and present officials who think only they should be able to vote on how our tax monies are spent. By comparison, we have the many representing all manners of social and economic classes within our community who believe large building projects deserve thoughtful consideration by all and a vote. Join the many and vote "yes" on Measures 3-394 and 3-395.

Right about now, Dina Manzo must be thinking to herself, "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."

I say that not to brag, since I completely credit the teacher with my success. But the fact that I could actually construct a book that had covers and pages and could be written in was thrilling.

Baker, two-time winner of the Kevin Kline Award, gives a impressive performance that reveals a man in which discipline, vanity and screwball racism are so mixed into one foul package that he's past redemption. The scene in which Baker and Davis recall the destruction of the Ghetto, pacing their cell and taking places at opposite sides, is a marvel. You can't possibly catch every word because they are speaking at the same time. But Baker's exultation and Davis' horror bleed into each other, an emotional cacophony that evokes a sense of the chaos of battle. It probably takes a director who is also the playwright to stage the scene that way.
Manning will be 36 this month, but he has no interest in retiring. He loves to play. He lives to play. He wants to win and win now. That will best be accomplished elsewhere, but Irsay stressed that Manning was unselfish throughout, that he honored the best interests of the Colts.

Adults, however, might think they’re watching a Cold War allegory. The very Christian L’Engle wrote her novel in 1959-60. Glore’s adaptation strips the story of its biblical allusions and direct quotations of Bible verse. Meg no longer fights Jesus’ battle of light against darkness, but now plays the role of dissident for individual liberty against an evil that enforces conformity through absolute rule, reprocessing camps, and central intelligence.

A pair of wild pitches scored Reynolds to make the score 9-0.

James comes out for his close-up looking tired and uninterested, probably because he's just ended a worldwide tour to promote his book and movie. His hair is the longest it has been since he was 16, and he's not interested in talking about 2010. When asked about what he did over the summer to work on his game, he rolls his eyes and becomes sarcastic saying he didn't even work out that much.

Meanwhile, as Saturday matinee after Saturday matinee came and passed, alongside the cinema, the small store of Mr. Bilder seemed to recede further and further into the shadows.

Add the remaining butter, increase the heat to medium-high and add the rest of the salt and the Brussels sprouts, stirring until the sprouts become limp, 2-3 minutes. Increase the heat to high, add the wine, and scrape up any clinging bits.

Even so, Congress doesn't have to tie its hands to do something meaningful about the deficit right this minute. Republicans need only find the political courage to embrace compromise and take the president up on his offer of a "grand deal" involving trillions of dollars in spending cuts and, to a lesser extent, tax reform that closes wasteful loopholes and requires a greater contribution from the wealthy.

I realize they don't hand out trophies in mid-season but a win tonight would have great symbolic value for the Blues. This franchise has gone through a lot over the last 5-6 years. Some of the negativity has been self-inflicted and some was shoved in their faces by the way the previous ownership group gutted the team prior to selling it. To move into the top spot in the Western Conference would be a form of validation. It would show that the plan the current management team has followed is working.

I'm inclined to agree, but not just because the usual closely watched indicators like employment, GDP, household employment and income growth are generally looking healthier these days. I'm swayed by the fact that builder confidence has risen by more than a third year over year (even though it slipped a bit in April from the month before). While builders tend to be an optimistic lot—otherwise, they wouldn't be in a business that requires them to make large capital outlays for land, labor and materials months or even years before a potential payoff—this uptick is significant.
Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, has raised more than $80,000, but he will use that money for his state auditor campaign instead.

Searching for the best spot for a quick nap at Coachella, many attendees quickly realized, is simply a lost cause. The only viable option? Sometimes, it means just plopping down to the ground, wherever you are.
Many of today's biggest problems seem impossible. The budget, taxes, immigration and unclear rules for the Internet have all languished for a decade because of a failure to find solutions in a partisan and gridlocked world. And yet, in a flash, the president accomplished a tax deal and repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military. By giving Republicans enough of what they want but also using the veto threat, Obama can add his moderates together with the Republicans to get deal after deal done -- especially on items that have broad public approval.
Successful countries know that education is an investment that pays off in 15 or 20 years, and make long-term plans. South Korea did precisely that, and it worked.

Case in point: DaVita Inc. A lot of factors played into DaVita’s decision to move its head office, and at least 300 new jobs so far, from El Segundo, Calif., to Denver, said CEO Kent Thiry. Yes, the company got up to $6 million in state and city tax breaks, but the No. 1 issue, Thiry said, was being able to attract and keep a quality workforce. Transportation was part of that.

That wouldn't be big news in East Lansing or Columbus, but it's an important benchmark for the Wolverines. Maintaining those deliberate, disciplined baby steps. This program isn't as good as those determined to push it forward faster than the Wolverines are capable of right now think.

Reno, Ed. Flies around the country all week pimping Botox for Allergan but makes sure he gets back in time to have a cigar with us on Friday afternoon and then have dinner with his family. Gotta respect that.
Don't misunderstand. The original "Star Wars" trilogy is a lot of fun and George Lucas corralled future generations of movie fans with his films' youthful spirit of wonder and adventure. But "Ben-Hur" is profound and ageless — not to mention challenging and stirring in its full-blooded depiction of man's capacity for both cruelty and redemption.
Still, the industry appears years away from fully recovering from its bust four years ago. Since the bubble burst, sales have slumped under the weight of foreclosures, tighter credit and falling prices.

This was the seventh straight year of Super Bowl-record viewership. It peaked at 117.7 million during its final half- hour, as the Giants’ Eli Manning directed a late-game touchdown drive that gave New York the lead, and a desperation game-ending throw to the end zone by New England’s Tom Brady fell incomplete.

A few hands shoot up, and the stories tumble out:
Presque Isle State Park, 301 Peninsula Drive #1, Erie, Pa., 814-833-7424: OK, it's not in Northeast Ohio. It's not even in Ohio. But this fantastic Erie beach is just an hour-and-a-half away by car -- and worth traveling much farther for. Located on an arching, 3,200-acre sandy peninsula that juts four miles into Lake Erie, it's arguably the best beach on the whole lake. In addition to swimming, boating, fishing and hiking, it also offers excellent migratory bird viewing.

For most of the visitors themselves — especially those in their twenties — it's about the bars that begin serving at 9 a.m. and a tradition of heavy drinking that has long been associated with the event.
Salads almost vibrate with flavor, the greens are so fresh and the dressings so poised on the edge of tart. You could start with fat asparagus roasted in the wood-burning oven in a composition of creamy white burrata, emerald mache leaves and a scattering of hazelnuts. Endive and watercress sparkle in a salad with tangerine segments, sweet Medjool dates and pistachios. For a green salad, butter lettuce in a Meyer lemon and tarragon cream adorned with sugar snap peas and a few stalks of asparagus makes a vivid entrance.

In one of the "Star Trek" films, in which Starfleet is headquartered in San Francisco, the bridge has been likewise modified. The point is: The modification of this bridge - destined to last for the half-millennium to come - has already been imagined. So why the almost nonverbal reluctance to implement antisuicide barriers?

Their own numbers indicate that about 17 percent of the students receive gifted services.

So the final act in 2010 for a fanbase that embraced their team as firmly as I've ever seen a team embraced by a major American city was: a serenade. Not "Don't Stop Believin'," because that wouldn't have been specific enough. Instead, the sold-out stadium sang "Lights," Perry's homesick ode to San Francisco. This was no drunken chorus or euphoric shout. This is a crowd as reverent as churchgoers, awed by what they've seen, proud of their team, and proud of their town.

Hey, Tony: How would you compare the West Coast offense with the Sam Rutigliano offense that Brian Sipe led? I ask because over my 48 years watching the Browns, I felt that offense was incredibly dynamic and threatening. Sipe was Colt McCoy's height and didn't have a rocket arm. The receivers were terrific, but not burners. That Sipe team scored TDs. Is there any team running that offense in the NFL? -- Robert Rose, New York

Instead, he sculpts realistic facsimiles from Aqua-Resin, a nontoxic, moldable resin that can be spread on metal mesh forms and painted with thinned-down acrylic paints. Holes cut in the mesh form create pockets for plants, and the finished piece of “driftwood” or “coral” provides some artful topography for the terrarium. If you have worked with papier-mâché, Druse says, you’ll find these materials easier to use. (Sold in craft stores, Aqua-Resin is available online from the Compleat Sculptor, sculpt.com.)

Moog cited the $11 million round Lincoln Park-based GrubHub.com raised from top-tier venture capital firm Benchmark as well as the nine-digit sales of Glenview-based SurePayroll.com and Itasca-based Accertify as other examples of "vibrancy" in the local startup scene. He also noted that Northern Calif.-based Twitter and Zynga - "two of the hottest companies in the world" - are now run by former Chicagoans (Dick Costolo and Mark Pincus respectively).
Maybe I just have a weakness for films about journalists in Rome, but critics agree this 1960 film is one of the top movies – many say the top movie – set in Rome. Marcello Mastroianni trolls the celebrity circuit around the Via Veneto in Fellini's jaded but ultimately sweet ("dolce") take on life. Worth watching if for nothing else than Anita Ekberg's dancing and her clinch with Mastroianni in – yes, in – the Trevi Fountain.

"Often times with a changing climate, it’s something that happens in little fits and starts and can kind of sneak up on you," Robinson said. "That can be dangerous. Whenever you get a big storm, what’s the first reaction? It’s, ‘Let’s rebuild, rebuild stronger.’ Is that the right answer? I’m not going to pass judgment. It’s a very, very difficult, contentious subject and one that will be with us for a long while."

Still, given the care taken on so many fronts, a few elements don't jibe. While I understand the casual family-style atmosphere, it seems inhospitable that when the wine or water is brought to the table, the waiter doesn't pour the first round. The staff will pour a taste of the wine for the host, and when it's accepted, he plunks the bottle in the middle of the table.
But the president insisted the gusher was coming under control. BP would be capturing 90% of the flow "in the coming days and weeks," he said.
Since CARS began on July 24, it has been riddled with problems.

In this case, the two female Shih Tzus do not get along. They will not grow out of it. It will continue to get worse. And the fact that they are small is irrelevant. Size doesn't matter with aggression. An eye is an eye.

The roof also was strengthened, inspiring visitors to once again look heavenward.

I was thinking this column might provide a convenient platform to suggest some New Year's resolutions for Journal readers this week, but I'm not qualified to offer personal behavior guidance. Then it occurred to me to consult with a few trusted experts to see what useful, practical life-coaching tips they could provide. So I turned to the great minds of some of America's favorite poets and philosophers: rock stars.

Every screening at this year's Telluride Film Festival was preceded by someone standing at a microphone and delivering what came to be known as the "SS" speech -- an appeal to consider the auditorium a sacred space, coupled with a request to turn off all cellphones, pagers, BlackBerrys and other communication gizmos that often blight the movie-going experience. The effort was successful, with a few piercing, trilling or warbling exceptions. Those who made the uphill pilgrimage to the 32nd annual festival in this picturesque old mining town, perched in the Rockies at an altitude of almost 9,000 feet, already shared a deep respect for the film medium. If cell-free reverence was in order, they were glad to give it a shot.
As excited as Spielberg and his friend Robert Zemeckis are about motion-capture, the technique needs a timeout. James Cameron used it brilliantly in “Avatar” because his characters were supposed to look otherworldly; used on human characters, it’s just creepy.

"I'm just biding my time," he says. "I'm in no hurry. I'm 86 now. I'm saddled with dislocated shoulders like Michael Jackson had — rotator cuffs in the shoulders that don't turn. They don't let you use your shoulders too good. I can pick up things, but I'd better be awfully careful. I can't bowl. I used to set pins as a youngster in the bowling alley. So that ended that pleasure. I haven't bowled since. That's been 40 years ago."

The NFLPA's complaint said it lent the coaches' group that amount "to cover payroll and other NFLCA expenses." The players' union also asked the court to determine whether NFLCA executive director David Cornwell was "lawfully elected" to that post.
This is a strange thing to say about Franzen. In his interviews and his essays, he's always seemed both grumpy and indecisive, a person who knows how he's coming across and still can't quite help it. That Harper's essay, for example, ends on a mildly optimistic note, but its most memorable lines arrive much earlier, when Franzen is savaging America's politics and pop culture. His best essays don't offer final thoughts so much as they reveal the process of thinking. It's what makes them so good - and so easy to argue with.

At least 10,000 people would be unable to move back. Multiply that by the hundreds of other camps, big and small, and the scope of the conundrum is clear.
Then a cloud slipped in front of the sun. A fast-moving shadow passed overhead. Except it wasn't a cloud. It was a condor! Circling and gliding, it swooped just yards from the trail, its massive wings (which can span up to 12 feet) dropping like a charcoal curtain in front of us. I stood there, so stunned and speechless that it did not occur to me to lift the camera around my neck. But luckily, I would get another chance — because for the next half-hour, we walked and watched as the magnificent birds looped and climbed, riding updrafts above our heads and along the steep canyon walls.
There's been handwringing among fans over potentially disappointing speeds, and concerns that IndyCar won't have a full 33-car field. While both are steeped in tradition, fans seem more upset about speed and car counts than the drivers.

While "Search" garnered positive reviews from NME, Pitchfork and NPR's "All Songs Considered," the attention didn't translate into national or even regional attention in the form of additional gigs. The idea of playing more shows outside of Northeast Ohio is definitely a goal -- and unfortunately so far a hurdle for the band. "We need to go out and play Chicago, New York City, Boston and stuff," Tolar said. "We've been contacting the clubs, but it's just tough. Sometimes I feel like I don't really understand why we're not able to get shows. We've gotten some decent press, I don't know why it's as hard as it is."

It's too early to predict economic losses from the drought, said Earl Hance, Maryland's agriculture secretary. But the risk of losses is a concern, he said.

They’ll have to. When Johnson and the Nets take the floor Friday, they will do so with a roster that still needs filling out. As of today, there is exactly one power forward on the roster, rookie Jordan Williams, who was a second-round pick in the June draft. Brook Lopez, once the future of the franchise, will take the floor unsure whether he will be playing center or power forward this season — or whether he’ll be trade bait as the organization tries to acquire Orlando Magic superstar center Dwight Howard.
Mohammad also is charged with bribing Russo to obtain jobs for friends and family members, and of paying Russo to obtain the job of chief deputy auditor.
The arena is one of the most important local stories for us to cover this year. If the arena moves forward, it will do so because of a decision to commit significant public resources to make it happen, with the hope it becomes a catalyst for railyard development.

If he passes that physical exam, Manning's $20 million salary for 2013 is guaranteed and so is his $20 million salary for 2014.

The ad campaign for "Safe House" is somewhat misleading, suggesting this is some kind of Denzel-as-bad-ass revenge movie. No. Just an OK action flick.
Waititi made 2007's eccentric love tale, Eagle vs. Shark, and like his debut feature this one incorporates purposefully primitive animated sequences and loads of (retro) pop-cult references. If the filmmaker relies too much on the deadpan and the arch, Boy is balanced out by Rolleston's smart, soulful performance.
"It’s hard not to feel a sense of disappointment even before tonight’s speech is delivered," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. "The goal isn’t to conquer the nation’s problems. It’s to conquer Republicans. The goal isn’t to prevent gridlock, but to guarantee it."

Each and every invading force, from the Spanish conquistadors to Maximilian, apparently decided they could do better than the locals were. And perhaps as a result, we've been left with a grafting of someone else's beer preference onto climate, soil and water conditions that never quite suited it.

"Both sides raise valid points, and this is a case in which one party or the other likely will suffer some degree of irreparable harm no matter how this court resolves the motion for a stay pending appeal," the majority wrote. "We do not agree, however, with the district court's apparent view that the balance of the equities tilts heavily in favor of the Players.

And shoot he did, making 17 of 26, including 3 of 5 from three-point range, one starting the Heat's comeback from a 91-84 deficit with 1:39 left, and the final two in overtime, piercing daggers to a Blazers team that thought it had its ninth consecutive home win wrapped up in regulation.
A. New Jersey is becoming more diverse. Right now, the state is 40 percent diverse. In a relatively short period of time, we will have no clear majority of diversity in the state. Certainly New Jersey companies have been paying attention to what that diversity means toward achieving their business goals. It’s well-documented that diverse groups work well at problem solving, developing their teams and achieving goals. At this point, a diverse society is here to stay and a great advantage for doing business and recruiting employees in our state. For the American Conference on Diversity, this is an organization whose mission and work meets these times and these needs perfectly.

The plan was meant as a pilot project to fine-tune the audit process before the Nov. 2 general election, when an audit will be required.

Morain's biggest issue, however, is the actual wording of the California Right to Know Genetically Modified Food Act, which could potentially bar companies from calling any product "natural" if it has been subject to "canning, smoking, pressing, cooking, freezing, dehydration, fermentation or milling."

Both sides protested strenuously that an issue affecting millions of Americans was being used for political gain.

I didn’t know what to expect when I joined a group of birders this past weekend at Sandy Ridge in North Ridgeville. On the walk through the woods to the ponds, the spice bush had nearly completed flowering, the May apples had formed a carpet on the forest floor, and the blooms of cut-leaved toothwort shimmered like snowflakes in the leaf litter.
We're sure they'll gladly take New York's season-reviving thumping of Colorado, Kansas City's legitimizing 2-1 victory over Dallas FC and New England's rare victory over visiting Portland. Add in D.C. United's scoreless draw at Vancouver to bring some humility to the West.
State lottery officials have said only that the winner is from Illinois, not necessarily the Red Bud area. The store that sold the winning ticket serves a number of customers just passing through town along Illinois Routes 3, 154 and 159.

Cleveland – that is not the America I know. That is not the America we believe in. A lot has changed since I came here in those final days of the last election, but what hasn't is the choice facing this country. It's still fear versus hope; the past versus the future. It's still a choice between sliding backward and moving forward. That's what this election is about. That's the choice you'll face in November.

"We're still here. We're still fighting. We still believe, as this race really shows," Santorum told supporters in Green Bay, Wis.
As the goalkeepers wandered out for warm-ups, the crowd erupted and I witnessed the phenomenon that is Hope Solo. She’s an extremely talented goalkeeper and athlete, and her smile was contagious as she high fived some waiting fans as she ran out to complete pre-game drills. The crowd yelled messages of encouragement. Ok, they yelled a lot, and the screams varied from actual words to just extremely high pitched wails. Solo did her best to keep on task, waiving to the crowd at points while going through her pre-match drills. The noise got more deafening as the full teams moved out for pre-match drills. I heard plenty of yells of “We love you” with the player’s name at the end to just about everyone, while the signs of support were now scattered throughout the park. As the crowd started to fill in, the noise became more apparent but instead of the usual crescendo of chants for the Timbers, the atmosphere felt more appropriate for a popular band.
"There are serious legal issues that arose right from the beginning in this case," said Mr. Gottlieb, who cited a court order to turn over records of private conversations he had with his client, an order he said violated the law.
"Bee Season," which was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, paints an idyllic picture of the family at the outset. (It does so almost literally -- a painterly glow suffuses Giles Nuttgens's cinematography.) The Naumanns seem as cultivated as they are prosperous. Saul plays string duets with his high-school-age son, Aaron (a fine performance by Max Minghella). Aaron helps his kid sister with Hebrew lessons for her bat mitzvah. Yet there's a harbinger of what's to come when Saul insists that Eliza understand the meaning of every Hebrew word, rather than learn her lessons by rote, and his wife, Miriam (Juliette Binoche) tells him he's being a bully. Eliza's fate is sealed once she manifests her eerie gift for visualizing the words she must spell correctly in a spelling bee. Saul, a student of Jewish mysticism, has failed to find God through Kabala, but he will strive to make his daughter a corrected version of himself.
By the sounds of it, that’s exactly what the Huskies want.

Utah gets the distinction of being the team that Washington beat for just its second road win of the season. The Wizards had been in danger of joining the 1990-91 Kings as the only 1-40 road teams in NBA history.
Being able to lead a company where I've spent the majority of my adult life and majority of my professional career is great. I say to people, "What am I going to complain about?" I feel like I have support of the people that I've worked with for the last 25 years. I think I have support of the investing public, because I've shown a willingness to not only go with the status quo.

We also tell them that abuse is never, ever their fault. You can share those same messages with your children at home. It's an important first step for your children to hear these messages -- often.

Scheduled for all day March 24th on the National Mall, the event doesn't sound too heavy, considering its topic. On the roster are musicians, a magician and comedian Paul Provenza. The goal, it seems, is to get non-religious fired up about politics and such the way the evangelicals seem to be.

If you decided to make a list of happy loving couples in American drama, chances are you wouldn't think to include George and Martha, the vicious and skillful marital warriors from "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" But there's a case to be made that Edward Albee's classic is as much love story and comedy -- however dark and lacerating it may be on both those counts -- as it is contemporary tragedy. That reportedly is the tack being taken by director David-Smith English in a Clackamas Rep production that stars an actual married couple -- Doren Elias and K.B. Mercer -- in the iconic lead roles, with Dennis Kelly and Annie Rimmer as the younger couple that strays into the line of fire. Opens 7:30 p.m. Friday, continues 7:30 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays, 2:30 p.m. Sundays through Oct. 9; Osterman Theatre, Clackamas Community College, 19600 Molalla Ave., Oregon City; $12-$22, 503-594-6047, clackamasrep.org

Camby is shooting 25.8 percent from the field (8 for 31) since returning and has gone without a single field goal in three games. It isn't that the Blazers need him to score big points, but they could use some scoring from him to force defenders to guard him and give LaMarcus Aldridge more room to operate.
U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, President Barack Obama's designated Supreme Court lawyer, will oppose it for the federal government.
Take a second ... think about what you ate yesterday ... now, write it all down. In most cases you would fail in this memory test and put palm to forehead when confronted with what you actually consumed. When I work with clients it is interesting to hear their reaction after even one week of accurate food logging. Personally, I found that my calories varied drastically from day to day and my well-balanced diet was nothing of the sort. I encourage anyone starting or currently in their fitness journey to utilize this simple tool and remember the following issues that many people are troubled by.

DEAR HELOISE: I made a list of ideas I got last Christmas and stapled it to the December calendar:
Kevin Hurst moved up from council president to mayor in January when Marlene Anielski departed for the Ohio House. A tool-and-die maker by trade, Hurst, 47, has trimmed personnel and has some promising ideas to bring more businesses to Walton Hills. He's opposed by William L. Allen, 63, an Ohio Lottery supervisor and former council colleague. Allen faults Hurst for moving ahead with construction of a park concession stand before enough money had been raised from donors to cover its cost, leaving the village with a $60,000 shortfall to absorb.

He wasn't referring to Iraq or Afghanistan, but America's truly endless war, the war on drugs. Declared 40 years ago by President Nixon, it chews up $41 billion in government spending each year while sending 2 million Americans to jail. Yet Nixon's goal of a drug-free America ("the final issue is not whether we will conquer drug abuse, but how soon") seems no closer to anyone but the drug warriors themselves.

The poll broke the participants down into various groups, including by age, race, gender and political party. Here are some of the results indicated by participants:
It's true that on average, state employees make more than private-sector workers. But the average says more about the professional-type jobs dominating the public work force, and the vast number of unskilled, low-paying jobs in the private sector, than it does about state pay practices.

Palmer built a fortune on real estate on Australia's Gold Coast tourist strip before becoming a coal mining magnate. BRW magazine reported he was Australia's fifth-richest person last year with more than 5 billion Australian dollars ($5.2 billion).
Harden was working on a 3-hitter and a 2-1 lead when Choo singled sharply up the middle with one out. On a 3-2 pitch to Hafner, Choo took off for second. The pitch was a ball, but when Texas catcher Taylor Teagarden's throw to second ticked off Elvis Andrus' glove, Choo continued to third. It paid off, as Jhonny Peralta hit a sacrifice fly to right, scoring Choo and tying the game at 2.

"It's not like I have time to discuss it with my staff," Matheny said. "It's going to be instinctual. I bark at them. But I don't bark to bark.

"I don't want this to sound too crass, but we've sort of made our pitch," said Webster, the son of the late Hall of Fame center Mike Webster of the Pittsburgh Steelers. "We hope the family choses us, but the important thing is somebody's going to get it and it's going to get looked into. Junior Seau was a wonderful man and we're all aware of his work with charities. I wish it never happened. The important thing is, in some way, this will continue his legacy on giving back to the community and helping people."
Bates, 35, was perhaps more grandly theatrical in his choice of instruments for "Alternative Energy," another major orchestral score.

In the final hours of session the Governor's septic bill passed which will require counties to establish separate tiers for planning uses. In tier four, for Harford County areas zoned for one development right per ten acres, this decrease will mean a reduction of development rights in Northern Harford County of 30 to 40 percent. This means that Harford County residents in the northern tier of the County will have a forced downzoning by the State of Maryland. This will mean reduced property values along with reduced capital borrowing ability for our farmers. It also places in jeopardy Harford County's award winning land preservation program.

Constructed in the 1870s, the building is one of downtown Cleveland's oldest and the longest-surviving structure in the city's Gateway district. And it's savable, say experts in historic preservation, with potential to become a restaurant and events center, or a small hotel.
Up close, the place is a rickety mess. Broken glass and chipped paint cover the floors. Walls and ceilings are stained brown with water damage. As wood pilings rot, the southeast corner is slowly falling into the Willamette River. Tight corners and basement levels reek with the astringent, eye-watering smells of mildew and a toxic, flammable chemical used in grain processing. Vagrants, graffiti artists and drug addicts routinely break in and leave trash behind, despite motion detectors and the nearby presence of the Portland Police Bureau's Mounted Patrol Unit. Dust coats every surface, and spider webs cling to every doorway and window. All the left-behind grain attracted a small army of animals, as a PDC spokesman who toured with us discovered the hard way when a rat scurried out of a dark corner and bumped into his shoes on its sprint to safety.

My daughter and I shared a salad flight, an appetizer flight and an entrée flight - the quail stuffed with shrimp and grits was a standout. For dessert, we tried a trio of Memphis classics. We thought that an Elvis-inspired peanut butter and banana combo missed the mark, but a homemade "moon pie" (marshmallow and graham cracker coated with chocolate) accompanied by RC Cola-ice cream float was a sweet ending to a lovely meal.

While the dessert spread is perfect for Valentine's Day, Elmer says it's a great choice for any special occasion. And the recipes can be used in other ways, as well. She suggests the orange sauce as a nice flavor complement to many chocolate desserts. The mousse can stand alone when it's put in small cups, maybe with a drizzle of the orange sauce over it. And the ice cream recipe makes just enough for a romantic dessert for two.
North looked like it would break on top in the bottom of the first inning when the Crusaders got back-to-back one-out singles from Conner Buenger and DJ Johnson.

NFC EAST: Yesterday’s column was devoted fully to the Eagles, so I won’t rehash only to say once again second-round pick Vinny Curry, the defensive end from Marshall by way of Neptune High School, was a real good pick. When the Giants sat at No. 32, they had three players in mind: Virginia Tech running back David Wilson, who they selected; LSU wide receiver Reuben Randle and UConn defensive lineman Kendall Reyes. So when they got to 64 and Randle was still on the board, it was a no-brainer for GM Jerry Reese and his crew. For once, Dallas owner Jerry Jones didn’t let his ego get in the way and mess up the team’s draft. The Cowboys actually made a good, calculated move up in the first round and got the guy, LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne, who might be the safest pick in the draft. By that, I mean at worst Claiborne will be a solid cover corner; at best he becomes an All-Pro. Washington might have become the biggest joke in the league. With all kinds of needs on a team that finished in last place in the division for the third time in four years, the Redskins took two quarterbacks with their first three picks.

He served as a mentor to both Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell and helped found the National Association of Evangelicals. As Rice's oldest grandson, Himes grew up in the heart of fundamentalism, planning to be a preacher like his father and grandfather before him. By the time he graduated from high school, however, he'd thoroughly rejected his upbringing and embraced Marxism (another fundamentalism he's since left behind). In The Sword of the Lord Himes works back through his family's history to seek out the forces that shaped fundamentalism, but never loses sight of the human beings at the center of the movement.

Bernanke indicated that the Fed regards keeping inflation in check as a higher priority than stimulating growth by, say, pushing more money into circulation. It's about trade-offs, he said. Monetary stimulus might ignite some short-term hiring, but inflation could also trigger a relapse to recession. So the Fed prefers a relatively slow recovery that, Bernanke and his colleagues hope, eventually develops more momentum and spurs hiring.
Martin punched one of the officers in the face and tried to take his gun, but after a struggle he ran away with the officers chasing, Kennelly said.
The last time I saw Cassell play was at the Bmorehoops.com All-Star Game at The Dome in East Baltimore last August. The 2012 game was the quintessential all-star event in the sense that defense was nowhere to be found and probably 60 percent of the field-goal attempts were dunks. But Cassell stood out by making seven or eight 3s of the ridiculous, step-back variety. They were the types of triples where you think, "Wow, that shot has no chance of going in" or simply, "What is he doing?" And then the 3 would fall and everyone would go crazy. Cassell did the same thing with Nike Baltimore Elite last summer and with Notre Dame Prep over the fall and winter. At some point, you have to acknowledge that there's nothing at all fluky about his game. Cassell's style may look a bit unorthodox, but he has proven over and over again that he's an elite outside shooter. The ACC is certainly a different animal, but doing it on the Nike EYBL circuit and in the New England Preparatory Schools Athletic Conference -- the highest levels of AAU and prep school -- cannot be discounted.

Such workers haven’t seen an increase in base pay since 1991, although tips probably rose as the cost of meals and travel went up.

Taveras took that show to low-A Quad Cities last summer and when he was in the lineup, he hit. He displayed developing power with 27 doubles, 40 extra-base hits (vs. 52 strikeouts) and a .444 on-base percentage. Taveras' .386 average was the highest for a batting champ in that league since 1956.

The play examines a strange kind of rivalry, between Legba, who longs for the sexual and emotional closeness he could enjoy with Oshoosi in prison, and Ogun, who has spent his life trying to control his brother’s taste for trouble. It is Oshoosi’s story, really, his journey of self-discovery (as “Red and Brown” is the childless woman Oya’s journey and “Marcus; Or the Secret of Sweet” is that of the young, gay title character). But Legba and Ogun loom larger in the cycle as a whole -- Legba as almost a trickster figure of the psychosexual, and Ogun as the stalwart, supportive presence in the lives of conflicted central characters.

Ryan Lavner, GolfWeek.com: "Everything looked so familiar, didn't it? The Sunday red. The Terminator stare. The confident stride. On the range before Sunday's final round, Woods launched iron after iron from the right side of the range, into a stiff breeze. LaCava stood behind him. Swing coach Sean Foley, dressed in all black, rotated around Woods every few swings, nodding in approval. For 20 minutes, the coach uttered not a word to the student, standing there more to offer moral support than actual guidance. Everything is stronger, sharper, cleaner now.

Orlando Bloom is Balian, a French blacksmith who's lost his faith since losing his beloved wife and infant son. The Lord, however, works in mysterious ways. The father Balian never knew, Godfrey of Ibelin, (Liam Neeson), a knight of great renown and even greater swordsmanship, has returned briefly to France from the east. He sees great things in his illegitimate son, perhaps because of the legend engraved on one of the beams of the smithy: "What man is a man who does not make the world better?" Initially, Balian is none too sure that father knows best, and declines the offer to join the Crusades; subsequent events make him decide that getting out of town isn't the worst idea in the known world. But can he measure up? Can he truly be the parfit gentil knight of Godfrey's yearning? Even if it means risking the loss of the woman he grows to love? Ibelin lays it right on the line: "My son: You are all that survives me. Don't disappoint me."

Still, when you get in the car for the drive home, the first thing you'll probably talk about is the food.

But "Coriolanus" belongs to Cox. The veteran character actor ("Troy," "Braveheart," Bournes "Identity" and "Supremacy," and so on) steals the show as the wily politician Menenius. It is delicious to watch him coaxing and cajoling with the slick finesse of a D.C. lobbyist.

And on Xmas Eve! Somewhere in hell Satan is tebowing, saying to Hitler 'Hey, Buffalo’s killing them'" -- is gaining attention for perhaps being the crudest.

Don't worry, be happy. Perhaps not a winning strategy in the day-to-day Darwinian striving for success, but for a meal at Paladar Latin Kitchen & Rum Bar, sheer genius. It may take a few minutes to get a table -- weekdays it's lively and weekends it's packed -- but once you're seated, it's Woodmere meets Margaritaville. The impressive range of sunny Latino food sambas to a Nuevo beat. Which means that the cuisine's distinctive south-of-the-border flavors are nuanced to appeal to an Americano palate. That translates deliciously into a bright, citrusy guacamole -- served with plantain, yucca, malanga and corn chips -- and a sweetly chile-scented Tuna and Melon Ceviche for appetizers. For comfort, try the Braised Beef Ropa Vieja -- richly napped Cuban pot roast and coriander-mellow Coconut Curry Vegetables. The sweet potatoes were too al dente, but the comforting side of brown rice and red beans made up for them. For fun, have the Mojo Marinated Atlantic Salmon, a nice juicy piece of fish served with cross-cultural yucca spaetzle. Most dishes don't pack a lot of heat. If you need that heady shot of spice, ask for Paladar's proprietary Caribbean Lime Hot Sauce. To cool off afterward, share a Coconut and Caramel Flan with someone you love. It's creamy and dreamy and perhaps the best flan in town. Just to make sure that everybody's happy, Paladar features vegetarian and vegan options, plus special menus for children, gluten-free diners and that dread pirate, Jack Sparrow. For him, and other discerning enthusiasts, there are more than 40 varieties of rum.

Bush famously warned the world in 2001 that "you're either with us or against us in this fight against terror" - and he might as well have been speaking directly to Pakistan, so fraught and amorphous are its interests and alliances in a precarious corner of the world. Yet 10 years after 9/11, Pakistanis have good cause to ask a similar question of the United States: Are you really with us or against us? And if the answer is the former ... then for how long?

-- The Oct. 7 elections in Venezuela. Despite electoral rules written to favor Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and uncontrolled government spending to support his election for a third term in office, which would end in 2019, there is growing discontent with Chavez's chaotic narcissist-Leninist model. Street crime is at record highs, economic growth is one of South America's lowest despite a record oil bonanza in recent years, and a recent ranking by Transparency International placed Venezuela among the world's most corrupt countries. Some polls show that Chavez may lose the 2012 election, but he may win due to a combination of massive government handouts, tighter press censorship and voter intimidation, if not outright fraud.

Chinese leaders are at an impasse over corruption. Corruption has wasted resources, fostered human rights violations and created distrust between the government and its stakeholders. Corruption threatens the country's political and economic stability as well as the viability of the Communist Party. However, the party can't effectively address corruption (the abuse of entrusted authority for illicit gain) without empowering citizens to monitor government. And it can't empower citizens without enhancing respect for some human rights.

'I got tired of people calling us "animals" on TV. I didn't want our community to look bad. I didn't want people to say bad things. All I've seen is looting and violence. I really haven't seen anything positive.'
We were never one of those families that wore Harry Potter outfits, memorized spells and waited on the sidewalk to buy the books at midnight. But my daughters grew up with Harry, and I did, too, in a way, between the reading aloud and the moviegoing, and sometimes I was embarrassed by how much I loved it. It was thrilling to be somewhere at once so exotic and so familiar, so redolent of the family history I'm already nostalgic for, now that my girls are older. The effect could not have been more powerful if a bunch of madeleines had suddenly rained down from the ceiling.

Many in Columbus, some who have never used the Ohio Turnpike, are now experts and think the Ohio Turnpike is simply a mini-ODOT. Turnpike revenue is collected through tolls (cash) at 31 locations, versus ODOT, which receives large payments from the Department of Taxation. The turnpike operates 16 service plazas, essentially mini-shopping centers. The turnpike has a credit rating separate from the state of Ohio. Additionally, the turnpike is a limited access highway where an accident can essentially trap vehicles on the roadway with no place to exit. This forces the turnpike to make provisions for emergency and towing services. McDonald's and a local buffet may both serve large amounts of hot food to many customers very quickly; they are, however, two distinctly different food-service concepts. Similarly, ODOT and the Ohio Turnpike are two distinctly different types of transportation systems.

* Here's what I believe Kroenke wants from his London alliance: the opportunity to play an annual home game there to strengthen his brand, which also serves the NFL's interest of establishing a consistent and the NFL's brand. This would be similar to what the Buffalo Bills have with Toronto. The Bills play an annual game in Toronto. The city of Toronto doesn't want to steal the Bills; Toronto just wants an annual NFL game.The Bills struggle to sell tickets in Buffalo so the Toronto game works for them; I believe it's an annual sellout. The Rams have struggled to sell tickets in St. Louis; this gives the organization one less boulder to push up the hill. And the Rams will receive a revenue boost from an annual "home" game in London.

A number of representatives overlook the symbolic importance of the barrier to naturalized citizens, focusing on the fact that we already have a talented pool of people from which to choose a president. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) got the bipartisan spirit of our endeavor, saying he'd favor a constitutional amendment to allow naturalized citizens to run for president, "even those I may not support myself." We hope mere partisanship isn't driving the views of others.

Bad: With the regular-season title out of reach, the Beavers can't have a Pac-12 tournament title as their only goal now - especially considering they have pretty much played themselves out of a first-round bye. As Robinson said, "The way we play going forward will affect the tournament.''
The summer movie season gets off to a raucous start with Marvel's superhero extravaganza "The Avengers." It's not just comic book geeks who are frothing at the mouth with excitement over the reunion of this elite squadron. Marvel's been building anticipation ever since 2008's "Iron Man" started raking in the big bucks ($585 million worldwide), and the success of "Iron Man 2," "Captain America" and "Thor" only added to the anticipation for the moment when the complete Avengers team could take over the cineplex.

It may be a prejudice, but people are continually surprised to find this caliber of restaurant in the Westin Hotel on Third Street just off Market. I can't tell you how many times people have written me to let me know they were skeptical but became converts after tasting Richard Corbo's take on rustic Venetian-inspired food. His specialties include a stellar sformato, a dense souffle made with lobster and ground polenta when I visited; perfectly done arancini (risotto balls); and halibut cheeks with polenta and jalapeno-mint marinara. With a sexy interior and one of the best outdoor spaces in the city, it's a great addition to the dining scene.
For three years, he’s been the backup catcher for the Yankees. Yesterday afternoon, he had no reason to believe this was going to change.

Sure, a marriage proposal is supposed to be romantic. But don't close your eyes to reality - especially when it comes to money. Your valentine may say "be mine." Yet when you tie your lives together, you'll also be joining a good part of your personal finances.

Matt Shelby, the district's public information officer and one of the eight found to have broken the law, says he believes the district had to play several different roles in all of this. The school district devised and developed the plan in the first place. The district, or at least the school board, was also making the request for money from the voters. Who else had the knowledge to explain the district's needs and answer questions, many of which were argumentative, to say the least.

Want to have a chance in Bork's court? You had better be rich and powerful, according to an analysis of his record as judge on the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by the Public Citizen Litigation Group. In split decisions, Bork always sided with businesses in legal battles with the government. And he nearly always sided with the government — most notably the Reagan administration — when challengers were workers, consumers and environmentalists. Public Citizen found that Bork's rulings offered no "consistent application of judicial restraint." Rather, it was the identity of the parties litigating that predicted Bork's vote.

More specifically, it has been awarded to a goaltender 15 times, more than any position. There is a principle reason for that. Blues coach Ken Hitchcock knows the logic well. Where success in the playoff is concerned, a "good" goalie isn't good enough. At some point, "great" has to enter the equation.
He's just an impressive person.
"Amare is a huge piece to this team," said center Tyson Chandler, who has moved past the stomach virus that limited him the first two games of the series. "Without him it will make it more difficult."

"In the last 15 years, it's actually about the only way that films that are not high-concept and salable in a 15-second spot or a poster can really gain a footing in the marketplace," said Ron Howard, the director of "Frost/Nixon." "It was cool before. Now it's essential."
Scotch: Famous Grouse ($19, 750ml), with a wee wisp of smoke and a body that works out three times a week, has to be where it's at for versatility. There's a reason that it's the best-selling blend in Scotland - thrifty Scots demand as much quality as they can get for their hard-earned poonds. And if you're on a budget but simply must have a single malt on hand, the Glenlivet 12-year-old ($25, 750ml) is the way to go. It has a little sweetness going for it that isn't to every malt-drinker's taste, but few people have anything bad to say. It makes for a great Rob Roy, too.
Sensitivity is a key component of humor - and travel. "It's exciting when anything is struggling," Armisen said. "The best time to be there is when it's not completely there yet. That's what is exciting about Detroit right now, that it's kind of reinventing itself and dealing with the fact that it already had its heyday as the center of the United States. It's struggling, which makes it such an attractive place."

The real holiday magic, though, is provided by my grandmother. Along with her sweet rice, she makes a list of family requests and dishes her mother used to make for the holidays.

"When we were there pleading with Gov. Kasich to negotiate, he told us to get on the bus, or he'll run us over with it. How am I supposed to trust him to sit down and negotiate in good faith?"
Looking back, Macias isn't sure how he ended up staying in San Francisco, but he's glad he did. Today, Macias' mother, four sisters and nine brothers all live in the Bay Area within a few minutes' drive of each other, and Macias has come to love the city as much as he enjoys cooking for it.
Driving milestones: There's a big difference between driving a truck and a race horse, but Andrew Coblentz has proven he can do both. Owner of Coblentz Trucking in Wooster, the 53-year-old rookie harness driver scored his first pari-mutuel win Oct. 3 behind the trotting mare Pretty Tech. After coming off the starting gate in slot No. 6, Coblentz guided Pretty Tech to the lead on a sloppy track and never looked back, winning by a half-length in 2:06.

A quarter-century ago, they knew the patrician George H.W. Bush was probably fibbing when he said he liked pork rinds, but voters weren’t put off by it because the gesture was oddly endearing in its clumsiness — a bit like a hapless but loving suitor who brings chocolates to his beloved’s diabetic mother.

"He's different from every other prince," LoBianco says. The others are arrogant, but there's something kind about him. I think one of the things that makes him different is that he gives her a chance (to get out of it). Everyone else would just have said, 'I won the riddles, here we go.'"

After months of tireless roadwork, his amiable folk-pop has developed some unexpected muscle, giving an anthemic drive to even his cuddliest songs. The way the five-piece band tore into "Modern Love," the title track from Nathanson's latest album, and the 2008 single "Come On Get Higher" made them sound vital in a way their studio counterparts are not.

Their false expectations were set by politicians who should have known better. Shortly after the protests began, their "general assembly" debated whether to risk bringing in tents.

Just as religion shouldn't be a reason to not vote for Mitt Romney because he's a Mormon, religion also shouldn't be a reason to vote for someone.
Some observers argue these private interest bills do, ultimately, benefit at least a portion of the public. Thad Kousser, associate professor of political science at UC San Diego, said legislators who introduce sponsored bills on behalf of industries are doing exactly what they are sent to Sacramento to do: represent the interests of their district. "What better way," he asked, to help "the employers of their constituents?"
The hot new health program is called Walk With A Doc and it's taking off for good reason.

The players and owners are busy whining about an unfair deal. But what about fans who are overpaying for tickets, parking, and concessions? The cost of taking a family to the game has soared to the point where even those who have been long term season-ticket holders don't really see the value, beyond games being a social event.
At Superior Street Elementary in Chatsworth, 43% of students are low-income. The previous threshold made a school eligible for aid when it reached 40% of enrollment. The new threshold is 50%.
The Barber of Seville is also the last opera to be performed by the Lyric Opera under general director Evan Luskin, who is retiring at the end of June.

“It’s not me versus Anthony Davis, its Kansas versus Kentucky,” Robinson said.
Mother Willis wears glasses and a soft red sweat suit. Her face is carved with wrinkles. She speaks with a thick accent that comes from the Deep South; her untamed gray hair springs in all directions. She stands, but remains hunched over -- a car accident 20 years ago left her with a serious back injury -- and she leans against the counter, stirring like a mad scientist.

Thus continued three trends that now encompass each of the four games the Tigers have played this season.
If there's one name that is synonymous with 1980s America, it's Ronald Reagan. He was elected in 1980 and served as president until 1989. He is associated with some of the seminal events of the decade - John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt to assassinate him in 1981, Reaganomics (also called supply-side economics, trickle-down economics, or voodoo economics - a reference that got play in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"), the invasion of Grenada, the Iran-Contra affair, and the signing with Mikhail Gorbachev of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty to limit the stockpile of nuclear arms.

While playing the Caped Crusader "was enjoyable," Bale said that there was a fine line to the character.

The public version of Bruce Wayne, the playboy, is a completely fabricated performance."
Like the committee she chairs, Feinstein seems to work best when there's a problem to be solved and speeches won't suffice. In her two decades in the Senate, she has passed some high-profile legislation, including an assault weapons ban and California desert protection.

Harrington was there. The group was bigger and the faces were younger. The message hasn't changed.
So when C.J. Sapong scored on a header two minutes into the second half, it was the only goal Kansas City would need. The sequence began with hard-luck goalkeeper Dan Kennedy getting a hand on a Graham Zusi blast from the edge of the penalty area. An inch higher and the shot would have gone over the net. Instead, it hit the crossbar and bounced back to Zusi, who headed it forward, allowing Sapong to redirect it into the goal.
Campbell was then at Homestead on Sunday for the Grand-Am race, and Shank said the two talked briefly about the Indy 500. Shank also said he's hoping IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard will work with Chevrolet and Honda to help small teams get engines.
* If Williams is reinstated, that doesn't mean the Rams will hire him back. It's too soon to know, though head coach Jeff Fisher clearly went out of his way last week to repeatedly praise Williams in a public setting. And don't forget that Fisher also hired Williams' son, Blake, as a defensive assistant. And Blake Williams isn't going anywhere (nor should he).
So on Saturday, as they have for each of the past four years, a group of Muslims from Orange County took a bus to Manzanar as part of the annual Manzanar Pilgrimage. Some 53 members of the Council on American-Islamic Relations rode the 240-mile (one-way) ride from Anaheim to visit the site of the one-time camp and gather around a squat, white obelisk that today marks the site.
His neck and back injuries required surgery and therapy.
This roundup of Rule 240 provisions doesn't present anything brand new, but the topic arose, in part, because a consumer advocate has just petitioned the Department of Transportation to make it a real rule, applicable uniformly to all lines. If you'd like to weigh in, you can submit an official comment to DOT. Log onto www.regulations.gov, enter "DOT-OST-2011-0079" in the Docket search box and then click on a comment button. Whether you regard such a rule as a major consumer benefit or just more unwarranted government interference with private business, make sure your opinion is heard.
"It's certainly going to be a unique experience," said Greg Bader, the Orioles' director of communications. "It's an area of our ballpark where we have had fans reference, 'What's up there, can we go up there?'

Labor Department figures. That disparity could be another reason for the high number of disability bias charges, said Robin Shaffert, senior director of corporate social responsibility for the American Association of People with Disabilities.
That might be easier said than done. Reporting a corrupt official can be costly, said attorney John Ricotta. A building inspector can hold up a job and cost a company hundreds of thousands of dollars, Ricotta said. That creates a dilemma.
"I wanted the students to have an opportunity to learn about things they don't always learn about," said organizer Holly Cordeiro, 20, a 2009 graduate now enrolled at City College of San Francisco. "They're so underrepresented."

"A bunch of my swimming friends say their teachers would never do that for them," said Bootsma, who also helped her cause by being an excellent student. "I owe them a lot for taking the time to help me after school and get my work set up. They've definitely played a part in this, because my parents never would have let me swim if my grades weren't good."

Detectives then went to Thomas' apartment on Hussa Street, where they found several thousand dollars worth of cocaine and marijuana and $14,000 cash which is suspected drug proceeds, police said.
Partly, it's because of the deafening silence this year around school funding. School districts aren't clamoring for more money right now, which gives the mistaken impression that Oregon's education troubles are ending. In truth, there's just a collective realization that every well is dry and there's no point asking for help.
McCourt made a tidy profit; why not give some money to Stow? In a submission that will run on Wednesday's letters page, Felice Sussman of Los Alamitos writes:

The quest to form a solid offensive front from left to right seemingly is endless. After doling out big bucks in free agency in 2009 to veterans Floyd Womack and John St. Clair, the Browns made two more additions this year. They signed ex-Raven Tony Pashos in free agency and drafted Arizona State's Shawn Lauvao in the third round. Pashos was signed to start at right tackle. Lauvao will compete with Womack to start at right guard. Left guard Eric Steinbach, one of a handful of NFL starting offensive linemen under 300 pounds and thought to be a potential casualty because of a $5.75 million salary, would appear to be safe another year. The absence of a salary cap certainly helps Steinbach.
"I used to play there all of the time when I was a kid," LBA League Manager Mitch Fusco said. "It's a huge part of our community. Nothing is going to change as far as the association. We're still going to be scheduling games and tournaments."

He said he won't go for either measure until a border bill is passed and the border is certified as secure, which could take years.
øHow many iPads could you buy? Assuming 5% sales tax, the iPad would wind up costing $523. What about your $4,000 gain in Apple stock? Since the investor held it for less than a year, the gain would be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, let's say, 20%. That means the after-tax gain after three months would be $3,200.

The rhino horn craze offers bigger payoffs than other exotic wildlife products such as bear bile or tiger bone paste. American officials say the crushed powder fetches up to $55,000 per kilogram in Asia ($25,000 per pound) - a price that can top the U.S. street value of cocaine, making the hoof-like substance literally as valuable as gold.

He also complains of bad media spin in the plot by al-Qaida in Yemen to bomb a U.S. jetliner on Christmas Day, 2009 — a plot that failed when the would-be bomber botched setting off his explosives on the plane. Bin Laden points out that the branch said the attempted bombing was in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike in Yemen. They should have said the attack was in support of the Palestinian cause, he said.
Olivia Newton-John will perform Saturday September 3 at Rams Head Live as part of Pink and Blue for Two, an event raising awareness of breast and prostate cancer. Admission to the event, which starts at $45, includes an open bar with cocktails from Grey Goose.
It's never been more evident watching the playoffs that the simplest way to get out of the first round is to find a freakish talent. There isn't another player built like Oden in this draft. Probably won't be one in the next, or maybe for a generation beyond that.
This is a belief, as the existence of Santa Claus is a belief. Neither belief will stand scrutiny, but belief alone is a powerful force. Why else (besides the cynical pursuit of votes) would lawmakers be willing to waste what potentially could be millions of scarce public dollars on purely mean legislation during tough economic times?

What suits her mother and brother to the job, she said, is an ability to communicate with frustrated players or disgruntled coaches, even as they try to keep a game clean and moving. They do this while within earshot of fans who may disagree with how a game is called.
If you miss having Rocky up on the bed, you can allow him back up after a couple of weeks. That's usually enough time to break a habit. But keep the kennel in your room (with an open door) in case he reverts to old behaviors. I suspect you'll find him in his kennel at other times because he will have learned that it's a good place to relax.

As with some personal information on Facebook, organ donor status can be kept private or shared publicly or only with friends.
A: The only alternative to removal is to leave them alone. There are two different schools of thought regarding the removal of wisdom teeth. One group recommends prophylactic removal prior to the development of any problems, and the other recommends waiting until a problem develops and removing them at that time. Unfortunately for the "wait and see" group, recovery from the surgery is usually quicker and easier for younger patients. Some wisdom teeth should never be removed if there is a high probability of damaging the underlying nerve, or causing an extensive loss of the bone surrounding the tooth.

Also on Thursday, the CDC released a survey on the use of tanning beds, booths or sun lamps, and Lichtenfeld said of the findings: "I am astounded."
He probably will retire long before anybody says he has to retire. But one imagines him joining the rush less often next year, and less often every year after that, until he stops joining it entirely and is just a stay-at-home defenseman, back in his own zone, alone, as much younger, faster players race toward him on a two-on-one.
For dessert, the apricot tart ($8) had a good pastry, but I had to search to find the fruit. The butterscotch sundae ($8) with caramelized nuts was simple and satisfying.

They have a lot (of dirt) on everybody, Small said,  'cause everybody was doing it.
It is just stuff-stuff that will eventually rot and rust, stuff that will be consumed by moths or stolen by thieves. At least that is how Jesus describes the treasures we accumulate on earth in Matthew 6. Jesus suggests that accumulating stuff is quite the opposite of grateful living. Living in gratitude frees us from stuff, opening us to God's way. Our stuff weighs us down, forcing us to choose between trusting in God's abundant provision and the anxious belief that says we have to have it all. Whatever you call treasure, says Jesus, reveals your primary allegiance in life.
The month of March features a Chocolate Walk and a Sushi Stroll. The tours take three to four hours, during which intrepid diners visit a multitude of spots to satiate their appetites. And then apparently walk off the calories. That's a win-win.
Meanwhile, the Beavers have gone 3-3. A big series win at home against No. 12 Stanford followed a disappointing series loss at USC.
The most vivid memory comes from 1964 or 1965 or maybe both. We would be, a handful of us, playing ball and onto the playground would walk Billy Williams, the Cubs great, holding the hand of one or more of his four daughters. We knew that he lived nearby and we knew, in the day, his statistics by heart: in 1964, 100 runs, 201 hits, 33 home runs, 98 RBI, a .312 batting average; in 1965, 115/203/34/108/.315.
Mayberg says that, over five years, no side effects have been observed in patients treated for depression with deep brain stimulation in a part of the brain called area 25. Perhaps, she speculates, the area where deep brain stimulation is done in Parkinson's disease patients has more signal traffic between nerve cells than does area 25.

As a wily, baseball-crazy 12-year-old, I learned that with a self-addressed stamped envelope, I could secure free game tickets for the Plain Dealer Grandstand Managers Night. On this sticky summer night, I led my mother, brother and buddy down West 3rd after a bus ride downtown. We entered the venerable Municipal Stadium and my heartbeat increased, as it always did when I looked upon the emerald field surrounded by its steel and concrete horseshoe. We found general admission seats just past the left-field foul pole, and about 20 rows back from outfielder Chuck Hinton.

One PG&E document notes that installation of the line was temporarily halted in September 1948 after X-ray examinations showed cracks in some welded seams. Local officials met with the pipe maker, Consolidated Western Steel of Los Angeles, along with representatives of PG&E.
The poor Red Sox must have felt like they were facing two aces today. First was the Verlander who relied heavily on his slider as he went through the Red Sox lineup. Then came the Verlander who complements his high-90s heat with nasty curveballs. He threw two straight curves to Red Sox shortstop Mike Aviles in the eighth inning that were so good, they were almost offensive. Aviles somehow managed to hit the second one for a soft lineout to shortstop. I might give Aviles some All-Star votes for that.
When the Ergenekon investigation began, some Turkish liberals hoped it might advance civilian controls over a military that had conducted four coups against elected governments in past decades. But the probe has expanded into an unending witch hunt, with no end in sight.

Instead of bringing a reliable witness like a police officer with him while he checked the recorders -- a BNSF policy -- Hildebrant entered the bungalow by himself. He looked at the data regarding the crash. According to his testimony, it showed that the crossing gate and other warning devices worked properly that night. Before he left, he downloaded the data onto his laptop. He later copied it onto a disc, according to the testimony of another BNSF employee.
No. 1 Seeds
Maybe I'm gullible, but I don't think they are acting. It's certainly much more interesting if they're not, because if their agitation is real, it says something about the actor mentality, something partly endearing and partly disturbing. It suggests a childlike vulnerability (that's the endearing part) combined with an ego hunger so big it's willing to devour anything, even the obvious equivalent of junk food, in a fruitless and never-ending pursuit of psychological nourishment. With that in mind, one can view the stars sitting in that ballroom as a collection of collagen-injected piranhas, floating in a
The Republican-American of Waterbury reports that the Connecticut game was played in honor of two local children who survived cancer and raised more than $45,000 for cancer research.

Team Antipodes, consisting of Terra Nova juniors Kjersti Chippindale, Emma Filar and Violet Replicon, capped off their most impressive season yet when they heard these words in front of a convention hall packed with their peers, mentors and legends in the field of robotics: "...and the PTC Robot Design Award goes to...(pause for envelope ripping)...team 4529, Antipodes, from Pacifica, California!" In that instant, a celebratory evening for their annual friends transformed into a surreal dream they had not dared to imagine. Those friends were now high-fiving the girls on their float up to the stage to receive congratulations from the judges and MIT professor Woody Flowers, the godfather of this sport.
Private-sector jobs in the US increased just 119,000 last month, according to a national employment report calculated by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers.

Young people's romantic, and by extension sexual, choices have a long history of being stigmatized. Look no further than the outrage over premarital sex, even after the advent of birth control. Today, with the exception of pockets of religious communities and Rick Santorum, we've mostly gone sex-positive as a nation. . . . In other words, we have more or less embraced the reality that young people have sex before they get married, so they might as well be doing it safely. Yet cohabitation seems to have replaced premarital sex as the axe to grind among everyone from social conservatives to psychologists. Given that 70 to 90 percent of young people will live together before they get married, though, it's a pretty shortsighted view to the issue.

Helm and his bandmates  Canadians Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel  were musical virtuosos who returned to the roots of American music in the late 1960s as other rockers veered into psychedelia, heavy metal and jams. The group's 1968 debut, Music From the Big Pink, and its follow-up, The Band, remain landmark albums of the era, and songs such as The Weight, Dixie Down and Cripple Creek have become rock standards.

For decades, many European companies had enjoyed deals that granted them half of the high-quality oil produced in Libyan fields.

Test results show that two types of wear have occurred at both units. Tubes are rubbing and vibrating against adjacent tubes, as well as against support structures inside the generators.
"Little Broken Hearts" little resembles Jones' previous four solo albums, from the vampy cover photo to its lyrical content and vaguely psychedelic sound. It's edgy, effects-laden and deeply personal. She's written a few songs she felt were this personal before, especially on her 2009 album "The Fall." But much of "Little Broken Hearts" centers on her life and the emotions you run through during relationship problems — from betrayal and indecision to healing and moving on.
øThe Devils' penalty-killing unit was so good in overtime that the Flyers never threatened in those four minutes.

“I’m a drug dealer, a major drug dealer, and I’m in the middle of a major drug deal. OK, even though the doctor did drugs, he’s still a physician. Who’s going to believe me? I can’t call the cops and say, ‘I’m in the middle of a drug deal and this man tried to rob me and kill me, so I shot him.’ Who’s going to believe me? I’m a junkie and drug dealer, and I’m in trouble.”

That isn't particularly likely since Phillip Anschutz, head of AEG, always has wanted to own part of whatever football team moves there and would presumably want a large cut of the Angels.

The ad showed LaMichael James walking up a tunnel in a high-tech uniform. It reads: "Yesterday's Fast is Today's Slow." The inference is that players at Oregon have access to innovative apparel that can't be found at other universities. That's a powerful recruiting tool.
Fortunately, we can expect that the courts will ultimately strike down this bill, if it becomes law, although only after years of protracted and expensive litigation. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case on this subject requires courts to balance the benefit to society against the burden on voters to assess this bill's constitutionality. Because this is the most extreme photo ID law in the country with respect to its harm to voters, and because the proponents could identify not one instance of existing voter fraud that would be deterred under this bill, the bill would be held unconstitutional.
Music has been central to Darlene Wedington-Clark's life since she was a child growing up in Philadelphia, one of five children of a preacher and his wife who valued music and higher education.
Even the mega-projects that succeed on one level are hard to justify as economic engines. Built in 1995, the $280 million Edward Jones Dome - paid for entirely by taxpayers - brought Rams football to town. Cardinals fans seem to enjoy the new Busch Stadium, which received $88 million of public money. But economists say professional sports don't generate many direct or indirect jobs.

It's often said that World War II defined a generation of Americans. Yet even as this "Greatest Generation" vanishes - in the United States, one veteran of this conflict dies every two minutes - this war has been handed down to their descendants as a cultural heirloom. World War II still inspires popular books (today, Laura Hillenbrand's "Unbroken," about an Olympic athlete's ordeal in a Japanese POW camp, marks its 74th week on The New York Times best seller list), movies ("The King's Speech" won four Oscars including Best Picture in 2011) and TV series (HBO's "The Pacific" won eight Emmys in 2010, more than any other program).

The recession, which caused a drop in payroll tax revenue and forced some people to retire earlier than they had planned, played a major role in eroding the system's finances.

Unless your children's school is federally regulated in that regard, the government cannot mandate anything. Therefore, this will have to be done by the school officials and the parents.

Unfortunately, no amount of Mary Martin wire work can save "Tarzan" from its fundamental shortcomings -- although this isn't for lack of trying. Not only do Tarzan and his adoptive family of gorillas spend much of the show swinging from vines, but the audience is also treated to an aerial dance of jungle flowers and what can only be described as a water fairy twirling through the air for the sole purpose of placing a fabric "waterfall" over the rocks.
David Ho, who has owned Sam Wo for the past 30 years, revealed this week that he could not afford to bring the building, with its precarious concrete balcony and idiosyncratic kitchen, up to health and safety standards.

That's the view that emerges from an Associated Press survey of 32 leading economists who foresee a gradually brighter jobs picture.

The top scorer when baked into brownies was Nestle Chocolatier ($5.49 for 8 ounces, Draeger's), with 62 percent cacao. These brownies were "moist," "fudgy with a pure chocolate flavor," "simple, straightforward" and "a bit too sweet." Three would buy this brand for baking; two might. It didn't fare nearly as well when tasted plain.
Police detained and questioned Eric Franklin, 19, and Eric McCreary, 18, in relation to the first theft. Officers found the two driving out of the subdivision. They later crashed into a utility pole at County Road 850 East and Ind. 334 after a brief police chase.

MEET THE PEOPLE: S.F. businessman Mike Patrick, member of the No Lawyers Luncheon Club, has applied for license plate HVI4286, which translates of course to Shakespeare's "Henry VI," Act 4, Scene 2, Line 86: "The first thing we do is kill all the lawyers." Members of the No Lawyers Luncheon Club have all had sorry experiences with lawyers, a sorry lot themselves ... Tom Youngblood dug the following out of an old book of toasts he found in his grandmother's attic: " 'Virtue in the middle!' said the devil as he seated himself between two lawyers."
Think about the before and after. It's a law borne out of some pretty visible messy situations -- lakes and rivers on fire, billions of tons of raw sewage. In many urban areas, you could smell the waterfront before you got to it, and it was a place to keep people away from. (Today,) two-thirds of the waterbodies we assess are meeting the criteria for swimming, meeting the criteria for fishing. It was an ambitious law. It still is today.

Who would have thought Pat Casey and his guys would be sitting in first place when we're 2/3 of the way through the season? Not many people, that's for sure. Though from the beginning, players and coaches said they were going to be better than everyone was giving them credit for. A few weeks ago in the dugout, Andrew Susac smiled and said, "I told you so! I told you before our first game we were going to be good. Now do you believe me?"
Still, automakers lack one consistent fire-prevention procedure for electric vehicle batteries, Emery said. Manufacturers, including GM and Nissan provide notebooks with recommendations. GM also sends in a team to drain the cars battery following any major Chevrolet Volt accident.

Cruz won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama -- the first Latino to do so -- for his story of Cuban-Americans caught between the traditional ways of the island they came from and the machine-driven modernity of their adopted home. His script is more than a reminder that Cuban exiles were active in America long before Castro took power, however. With its lush, metaphorical language and rich sensory detail, it paints a romantic picture of the immigrant experience, hovering between passionate hope and crushing realism.
But enough about the 3-year-old. Her opinion isn't really relevant, as half the time she goes outside without remembering to put on pants (not necessarily an anomaly in my family).
"This is good for America, it’s good for New Jersey," U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said of the Senate bill. "It’s about putting people to work. It’s about getting people to work."

My only aggravation is that 15-year-old Cheetah Boy seems to wait until the last minute every night and then throw one day's worth of clothes in the washer. I have asked him 8,012 times not to do this, but apparently his brain cannot think more than 24 hours ahead, unless it involves getting a drivers' license, in which case he can plan years in advance.
All are small. The Troutdale market usually has 15-18 vendors, Sunnyside 10-15 and Fairview 25-35. The number of vendors changes with the weather and the seasons, Tuomala said, but he works with farmers and their offerings "on how to make it work."
Chandler police also said they verified the 911 call through Hernandez's cellphone records. Several people called Hernandez after the crash, but, based on the cellphone records, it wasn't clear if he answered any of the calls or if his voicemail picked them up.
But with the fetus that far along, doctors knew they were already on dangerous ground. They advised Soto of the risks: Surgeons might have to remove her uterus or cut out a part of her bowel.

That superficial stability is threatened when the queen receives what can accurately be described as a human gift delivered in a wood box. An African dwarf, Nabo Sensugali (KeiLyn Durrel Jones), has arrived to amuse the bored queen. This was a common practice at European courts in that era; the play's title is a reference to a famous Spanish painting in which a royal family's entourage includes a dwarf.

The decision to count on federal funds means that every Portland elementary and middle school will have at least a half-time physical education teacher this fall, rather than lose PE entirely, Superintendent Carole Smith said.

Columbus -- With everything else Ohio State has to worry about during the first five games of the season, there isn't much room for concern about J.B. Shugarts' feet. The senior right tackle was forced to the sidelines after halftime of two games in the middle of last season, but he said after Saturday's scrimmage that those foot problems are behind him.

The only proposal left on the table is the Gateway Tunnel from Secaucus to an expanded New York Penn Station, Amtrak’s alternative to a commuter rail tunnel project terminated 18 months ago by Gov. Chris Christie.
The format of the test is not at all easy to manipulate. In order to see the questions, students must view the text on a split screen. This split screen does not make it easy to identify text features, graphs, charts, illustrations, or to look back into the source material to prove their answers. The state provided little or no practice materials for students. The state knew this format was coming years ago and refused to update FCAT Explorer. This has been destined to fail, and many students will.

But, writes the columnist, "Romney has the same perceived 'flaws' and he's going to win the nomination. Portman can't fix Romney's flaws. Neither can anyone else. That means all other things being equal, Romney will look for someone he knows and trusts; who has delivered for him; who can put a vital swing state in play; who can immediately help him tackle the hardest issues if he's elected; and whose selection tells the country Romney's first big decision as a nominee wasn't a gasket-blowing gamble or one festooned with the garish and outmoded trappings of regional or ideological balance."

Lucy, the youngest, is the first to discover that an armoire or "wardrobe" in a spare room is a doorway to an enchanted land. The land is Narnia, which exists in perpetual winter, ever since a wicked witch (Swinton) put her spell on it. Lucy, who is about 9, is played by first-time actress Georgie Henley, an auburn-haired girl with a witty character face that can only be English. She's adorable and a fine, instinctive actress. Lucy meets a diffident faun (James McAvoy), and there's something charming, almost magical, in their interaction.

A YouTube video posted in March shows a traffic stop of Ohio resident Terrance Huff by Collinsville Police Officer Michael Reichert as Huff and a friend were traveling from St. Louis. In the 17-minute video, Huff suggests that he was stopped without the officer having probable cause, as required by law, and that Reichert coached his K-9 dog to detect a scent of drugs so that he would have a reason to search Huff's car. No drugs were found and Huff was allowed to leave without receiving a traffic ticket.

The proposal would represent a reversal for Obama. In contrast to his pledge to target tax increases at the wealthy, high-income families would largely be spared from tax increases that would result from changing the way inflation is measured.

Also, if "corporate" is timing their employees, then maybe they should dispense with having the employees greet customers with a long list of item suggestions before taking the order. Those of us at the other end of the speaker often cannot understand a word being said, either because the speaker isn't working properly, the order-taker has a thick accent, or the person is speaking too fast. - Peggy In Thornton, Colo.

Tomlinson spoke directly to Seau's parents, telling them: "Mama Seau, Papa Seau, it's time for you to take a bow. Why?

As bad as the figures are, the outward appearance in Ciudad Real is one of stability and solidity, and in Madrid and in many other places, elegance and wealth. Where are all the unemployed? The common response is that Spain's saving grace is its black economy, where tradesmen and small businessmen deal with customers in cash and don't pay taxes. Economists say such off-the-books activities may be a quarter the size of the official economy. As for the younger unemployed, they often live with their parents until they are 30 or even older.
The government is trying to equip Irish workers with the skills to land jobs at these global companies, a task that is trickier than it seems.

Ireland is the only EU member state where learning a modern foreign language isn't compulsory in school.
Guanajuato is filled with history -- bullet holes from the Mexican war of independence still pock city buildings -- and estudiantina groups have a lineage that stretches back before the Spanish conquest.

It's not a coincidence that the two main characters of the book, David and Franny, were employed as a dentist and an aesthetician, respectively.

Practicing a few balancing acts every day is smart prevention, because moves that force you to stay upright help maintain muscle as you age.

The Raptors had wedged the shooting guard into the point position, playing backup to Jose Calderon, but that wasn't working. At the two guard, Forbes has played well in recent weeks.

He tallied a double-double at Chicago (13 rebounds and 12 points), followed by 21 points against the Magic. And he played splendid basketball against the Nuggets last week, scoring 11 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in just 19 minutes. He hit a big 3-pointer, launching the shot near Denver coach George Karl.
"In the Rainforest you have three sauna-steam rooms and various ocean-inspired shower rooms. It’s fun to try them all and choose one you like best. At any given point, you can go from a soothing tropical rain showering your body to a cold arctic waterfall blast pummeling your neck. I liked the warm showers, the scented misting experiences and the hamam sauna the best. The latter was a cross between a dry sauna and a steam room.

The idea source: Holmquist bought a mobile sharpening business in 2000 from a man who sharpened shears for a haircutting business. That equipment didn't meet Holmquist's standards, so he redesigned it. After selling the new equipment online for two years -- 400 units -- Holmquist set up an unemployed friend up in the sharpening business. That worked so well that Holmquist decided to start the franchising company.

If our nation's voters want to move government policy far to the right, they are entirely free to do so. But those who regard themselves as centrist have a moral obligation to make clear what the stakes are in the current debate.

I called CASA, left a message for Atteberry and then e-mailed Israelson to ask why he wanted to contact Atteberry. He would only say he wanted to apologize. Weeks later, Atteberry returned my call.

The biggest twist here is that the chefs have to gather the ingredients themselves, from the land or the sea, then clean it and cook it under "primitive" conditions. I'm not keen on the hunting and fishing aspects of the show — what did that poor little opossum ever do to you, Madison Cowan, except remind you that you hate rats, to which they are not related?

The United States is among the few modern economies in the world that still circulate such a low-denomination paper currency. Today's dollar buys about as much as a quarter did in the 1970s. In Canada, the lowest paper currency is the $5 bill, and in Japan it's the 5 yen ($12). And yet, year after year, the U.S. government churns out billions of $1 bills to replace the billions of worn-out dollars that are shredded and dumped in landfills -- at your expense. Dollar coins, meanwhile, are virtually indestructible, fully recyclable, and have a lifespan of 30 or more years. It's simply a better, more efficient product.

I can't remember the count, but Boudreau hit a bouncer up the middle that just barely eluded shortstop Snuffy Stirnweiss racing to his left. When the ball went through, the noise was so loud the stadium started to vibrate as if an earthquake had hit. Fans were crying and shouting and stamping their feet. The roar went on for at least five minutes, and play was suspended because the Yankees were standing and looking at the crowd in disbelief, I think. I can still "feel" the stands vibrating as I write this.

Characters from the past have returned, including Bree's gay son, Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom), who introduced his mother to his new heiress girlfriend. Bree accused him of getting involved with the young woman only for her money and even showed how far she's come in accepting her son's sexual identity: "You love Italian shoes, you love mid-century modern furniture, and according to your Internet history, you love Army doctors giving elaborate physicals to young recruits, but you do not love girls! . . . Honey, you're here, you're queer, I'm used to it!"

I wonder if a Brown-Stall romance was brewing in Hood's Mill a century ago, back when dating would have been much different.

So I am happy he picked Hanalei this year - a glorious crescent of golden sand on the north shore of Kauai, where I taught my son to body surf. The beach is wide, the development around it is low-key and it's the kind of place where you could swim for hours or stroll for a day. It's home to the Princeville Resort (currently closed for renovations), though I prefer to rent a house down in the town of Hanalei.

One of the appetizerlike dishes is a takeoff on hot artichoke dip that subs in fava beans as a thickener and flavor agent, with a mozzarella, goat and cream cheese combination bulking it up. The artichoke "heart" component in the menu description materialized as individual leaves and bits of the heart, but the artichoke flavor was fully in evidence, and the dish was one of those that compelled revisiting until every last bit was gone.
The assessment, which included interviews with about 100 people including 60 survivors, local media, business owners and city and school officials, said the government now plans to reexamine ways to more clearly communicate the risk of dangerous storms.

“We always reserved the right to go anywhere to get Osama bin Laden, I said that very clearly in the response that I made. Many people believed as I did it was naive on the part of the president, at that time the candidate, to say he would go into Pakistan. It was a very, if you will, fragile and flammable time in Pakistan and I thought it was a mistake of his as a candidate for the presidency of the United States to announce that he would go in,” Romney said. “I’d rather just to say as I did we reserve the right to go where we feel appropriate to secure the interests of the United States of America and certainly track Osama bin Laden to anywhere that we found him.”

Mike Holmgren: "First of all, yes I would be happy to do that. But first of all I just want to compliment Tom Heckert, our scouts, our personnel grouping and of course our coaches and Pat. They work beautifully together in the lead up to the draft. I think one of the beauties of our place and how we do this is that we do have a lot of meetings together. That funnels in and then Pat and Tom and I had a series of meetings for the last three months in developing a strategy for this draft. Part of that strategy was to look very, very hard at picking a quarterback. I think we all liked Brandon as a player, I think everybody did in the league. The one caveat there, I guess, would be his age. Once we talked through that and got over that hurdle so to speak then he became very attractive to us. We had made a mention of the philosophy we're going to have here every year in looking at quarterbacks. I've said that any number of times, Pat has said it, Tom has said it. And the exciting part of this is that we took him in the first round. There were some things that transpired in that first round as always does as you're going through the draft. So instead of waiting and rolling the dice just a little bit perhaps and seeing another way to go there we said, 'Lets not run the risk and take Brandon at the 22nd pick.' We're very excited to have him. You saw, you got a little taste of it when he was in here of how he's different than all the other quarterbacks that were drafted ahead of him or behind him is that his age and his maturity and what he brings immediately to the table. Now, you couple that with his skill level, which is pretty obvious on film and he has the potential I think to play well sooner because of that than other quarterbacks in the draft so he became very attractive to us. I know there are all sorts of side stories swirling around that. I think both Pat and I addressed that yesterday. In fairness to everyone that will probably be an ongoing thing but right now we have our team, we have our quarterbacks in place and that's how we're planning to go forward."

Nicknamed "America's oldest teenager" for his fresh-scrubbed look, Clark and "American Bandstand" not only gave young fans what they wanted, it gave their parents a measure of assurance that this new music craze was not as scruffy or as scary as they feared.

Either way, there are few dishes unworthy of praise. One night's tomatoey stewed lima beans ($5) and bitter braised endive ($5) added up to a perfect vegetarian dinner with an order of simple hummus ($5) and warm pita. The pita is far from perfunctory; seasoned assertively and grilled briefly, it stands on its own, as do the grilled, seasoned bread rounds that come gratis at meal's start. These disappeared instantly alongside one evening's generous Greek salad ($6 small, $11 super large) or simpler horiatiki ($7, $13), basically a Greek salad minus the lettuce and the scoop of rich potato salad.

Perhaps Mr. Alonso doesn't walk down to the basement level very often. That's understandable. But is North Avenue really so big a place that a quarter-million-dollar contract should not involve his or the board's approval at some point? Shouldn't the buck stop at the CEO's desk?

One of the most famous Holmes stories of all becomes fodder for the third of the new shows. Conan Doyle fans know what happens at the end of "The Final Problem" when the author tried to end his wildly popular Holmes series at Reichenbach Falls.

But the actual fall of the title doesn't involve rushing water, and that's all I'll say about it.

But first, ODOT needs to take another look at its priority list. How can it downgrade replacing a bridge its own engineers say has major structural problems? How can it justify more uncertainty in the heart of Ohio's most populous region? How can it ignore the needs of an interstate highway that has to go above a massive river valley? Getting the Inner Belt done as quickly as possible isn't parochialism, it's common sense -- and this region must make that crystal clear to Columbus.

"That legislative redistricting is orchestrated by political figures and consistently has had significant political consequences suggests that political motives figure prominently into the process," said Benjamin Brickner, the report’s author.

Pat Shurmur, on what they loved about Weeden: "I think number one, he has the attributes you are looking for in a quarterback. He is a winner. He obviously took a non-traditional path to being a college quarterback, but he is a very mature guy. He is an outstanding thrower. He is a good decision maker. He is very accurate. He found a way at Oklahoma State to really compete and win a lot of football games against a lot of the quarterbacks that we've been talking about leading up to the draft. We feel like the kid is a winner. I wasn't concerned about his age. I was impressed with his maturity and the way he handled himself, and obviously as a coach watching his productivity on tape and he is a quarterback who helped to lead his team to a lot of victories."

Second, supporters of the public bridge predict traffic volumes will rise to new peak levels in the next 25 years, leading to congestion unless capacity is added. This is a hotly disputed point. Moroun points out that the volume of border crossings plummeted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Traffic has been rising as the economy picks up, but it's still only a little more than half of the totals of the late 1990s. Passenger-car traffic is down more sharply than truck traffic, as more stringent border security measures apparently have discouraged casual visitors.

Adam: This contest is a legitimate dream match for me as a wrestling fan. I've long been a fan of both men, so the prospect of seeing them face off on the grandest stage of all is an amazing feel. I, too, expect this match to be the best of the night from an in-ring standpoint and just hope it will be alloted enough time to truly become something special, a WrestleMania classic for the ages. While I still don't feel the addition of Punk's family crises was necessary, it helps add to this feud, which I believe is only getting started. Punk and Jericho are too good a pairing to only have one match, and ultimately, I believe Jericho will sneak out with the win and the WWE title. Jericho will be able to gloat and carry the mantle of "best in the world" right into a series of rematches.

More than anything, it’s a farce, a roundelay of cruel violence that ascends to a nearly absurd comic pitch. It’s set within the milieu of Irish republican terrorists, and much of its dark humor is directed at the retributive pettiness of “the Troubles.” But it also addresses a broader tendency to lose sight of humanity in the face of irrational passions and impulses.

Pork belly ($12) is given even more heft with a poached egg and lentils.
1. Quinn should be a weapon in the Spagnuolo system. Spags is a master at concocting a pass rush. He's among the best in the NFL in coming up with ways to hassle the QB. Spags needs to have a good supply of rushers. It's the life blood to his system. The more pass rushers he has, the more imposing his system will be. And Quinn -- according to every pre-draft report I've read -- is a potentially spectacular edge rusher. I haven't seen one credible draft expert 'diss Quinn's pass-rush skills. They have other concerns -- can he handle the point of attack on runs? -- but no one disputes his ability to get after the QB. Spags can have a lot of fun messing with offensive coordinators as he moves Quinn around, aiming him at the pocket. And you cannot assess this pick without putting it into the context of how Quinn will be utilized by Spagnuolo and defensive coordinator Ken Flajole. It isn't just that Quinn is a pass rusher; he is a pass rusher that is joining a team with a HC who maximizes the ability of a pass rusher.

Chez Panisse has trained a lot of disciples in its 40-plus years, but no one is as true to the cause as Russell Moore. He cooked at the restaurant for two decades before going out on his own four years ago with Allison Hopelain. Each of his three main courses, which change nightly, is cooked over open flames in the altar-like kitchen. It could be grilled pork leg paired with smoked shoulder; mushrooms with beets and farro roasted in the wood oven; or a half Dungeness crab grilled in the fireplace. Moore has created a serious temple of food; even the dining room feels a bit monastic. Two 30-foot redwood tables cut from one tree are framed by chairs that came from a church in England.

There is a London I often summon in my imagination, one I've found in movies or novels, which I imagine would lead to a life romantic, sad and poignant. This London is brown. Its air is thick with brown fog, its men dress in brown suits, its women in brown dresses set off with a hat or scarf of red. Street lighting is faded.

Although it's based on an actual case involving a dolphin that lost its tail and had to learn to live with an ingeniously crafted prosthetic tail, "Dolphin Tale" has been amply fitted with enough dramatic elements to ensure that it works as an inspirational tale.

Obama has long expressed a complicated view of national security, but it was initially obscured by his strong opposition to the Iraq war. Less widely noticed was his attempt to balance that with vows to send more troops to Afghanistan and unilaterally strike inside Pakistan if necessary to capture or kill Bin Laden. At the time, many analysts thought those positions were more about avoiding the historic trap that past anti-war Democrats had fallen into. But four years later, Obama has presided over a policy that has married elements of both parties.

The Big Green Eggs, which are the large ceramic grill / smokers, seem to receive great reviews from my friends who have used them.

I remember seeing one of them at a Kansas City Barbecue Society event in Memphis 10 years ago and thinking how weird it looked and how it wouldn't catch on. Good call, Dave.

My companion and I could have been perfectly content sipping a cocktail or two while slipping our teeth through the crisp veneer of spicy crab-filled egg rolls paired with a gingery mustard sauce and blood orange aioli for dipping. Chef Rachel Speith works her imaginative treatments of high-end ingredients with a sure hand, such as her spot-on execution of seared foie gras presented with a warm lentil salad (less salt, please) and a jazzy herbed apple compote, the whisper of thyme playing perfectly against the fruit and fat liver. Devotees who dote on distinctive salads may find it hard to choose; the five offered here may cover green-market conventions -- Caesar, frisee, field greens and spinach -- but each is handled with finesse. We were charmed by the wintry contrast of warm baby mustard greens with a spill of earthy cultivated wild mushrooms and a bacon-laced apple cider dressing, showered with pine nuts.

Here's a new skirt I made back at the beginning of July. It's my take on the high wasit trend seen on shorts and jeans. I might make some shorts or wide legged pants with a similar waist, if I ever find fabric I'd like to make them out of. The waistband on this skirt is high, thick, fitted, and has four little buttons in an upside-down trapezoid shape. I'll wear it again soon and have some better pictures up, but I was spending the day with my friend there since this is right before I moved back from my hometown to my college town.
However, in spite of their outstanding performances and records, they don’t crack the top three – such were the performances at the top of the scale this year. You see, Heidler, Demus and Chicherova all had two losses in a year where perfection was the order of the day. And in 2011 there were three women that were perfect in three very different events.

Maybe it's because there's so much meaning in Ray's lyrics, maybe it's because Ray stands with George Harrison and Frank Zappa as one of the great idols of my youth, but there's such irony in Ray Davies telling us that his music is only there to dance to. Perhaps it's a comment on the direction they were taking, opting for a more commercial sound upon signing to Arista Records in 1976.

Work the next two days were incredibly hard. I have a difficult job as it is, challenging to navigate the work itself but you throw people’s personalities on top of it and I’m done. Sometimes I just reach my limit and it was that week. A perfect storm of stress, emotions, and physical exertion. I hit that wall so fast, and so hard I never saw it coming. I seemed the same on the surface but underneath, it was blank. I didn’t go back to the gym until Saturday, 4 days later, and only spent about 30 minutes there doing some cardio.
I don’t know if this is a deliberate act by the locals designed to keep us walkers on tenterhooks but this is the last section of wall our heroes see today. Not that we are disheartened. The rest of the walk is quite charming. If one can ignore the increasing number of bogs of mud, faeces, water and urine at every gate, style and ladder. Yes, Ok so we all know it’s only Bovine and Ovine but that doesn’t stop the sinking feeling that enters your stomach as your foot slips beneath the crust of a green bit and the gloupy suckiness tries to enter your footwear. At least that’s the impression Our Hero got whenever his Trusty Side-kick looked upon yet another fan of concentrated country-side on each side of a crossing point between fields.

Since childhood, Sabriel has lived outside the walls of the Old Kingdom, away from the power of Free Magic, and away from the Dead who refuse to stay dead. But now her father, the Mage Abhorson, is missing, and Sabriel must cross into that world to find him. With Mogget, whose feline form hides a powerful, perhaps malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage, Sabriel travels deep into the Old Kingdom. There she confronts an evil that threatens much more than her life, and comes face to face with her own hidden destiny.

We stayed at a resort in Jindabyne, and drove into the Kosciuszko National Park twice, to the snow fields at Perisher. Despite being the end of the season, there was plenty of white stuff to play in ... just a little icy and slushy at the base of the hill. The roads were clear and dry, not crowded, which made the trip a 20 minute breeze compared to Pete's tales of 3 hour bumpy rides using chains in a crawling stream of traffic.
Zara Home does not have stores in the US nor do they ship online orders ship to America. This retail embargo irks me because I love me some ZH merchandise. Their product lineup reminds me of Anthropologie, albeit some of it is less crafty/bohemian looking.

Slightly embarrassed by the yellow hanky mix up that took place at the Ramrod, or whatever club it was (it was the one with the hubcap motif), Steve is more determined than ever to immerse himself into the gay leather bar scene. And what better way to do so than to lift weights in your apartment as "It's So Easy" by Willy DeVille kicks some serious ass on the soundtrack. And it doesn't end with sculpting his Italian-American physique. Nuh-uh. Letting guys size him up at the clubs (of course, making sure you have the correct hankie in your back pocket when said sizing up commences), developing a rapport with the bartenders, Steve is on the fast track to becoming a regular. Which is weird, because it took me a couple of months just to get to the point where I felt comfortable enough to ask the bartender at my favourite nightclub what time it was. But then again, Steve is racing against the clock (um, hello? there's a killer on the loose).

I've been getting into more of a routine as I've figured out my schedule a little bit more. I usually get up around 6:00 A.M. each school day. This gives me time to read my scriptures and eat breakfast before I head to school by 7:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Mondays and Wednesdays I use a treadmill, bike, or elliptical machine in the gym on the first floor our our building while reading. I leave for school on Mondays and Wednesdays around 9:00. In every spare minute I have, I am constantly reading. The time I take commuting to Evanston on the "L" is always homework time, reading for one of my classes. My assignments for all of my classes makes it so that I'm reading anywhere from 150-200 pages a night. I try to skim where I can, but it's harder to get the gist of scholarly journals if you aren't paying close attention. I'm figuring out the balance though.
Working through Coltrane’s catalogue I then branched out into other musicians from the same era (and just before). There were many whose work I enjoyed: Coleman Hawkins; Dexter Gordon; Chet Baker; Cannonball Adderley; Bill Evans. I started reading about the characters. I then came across a book, But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer. If you like jazz (whatever era) and you’ve not read this do yourself a favour and order it before reading on. Dyer imagines scenes from the lives of various musicians, held together with an over arching narrative based on Ellington. The book is being reprinted this year. At its end it contains an essay, and some recommended listening. The essay is provocative (some digs at the Wynton Marsalis view of jazz (which I have some sympathy with, despite having attended a couple of fantastic concerts by Marsalis and his Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with some star solos by Joe Temperley) and praised some of the European jazz – particularly from the nordic area. The essay was preaching to the converted in some ways. Following up the musicians who’d played with Miles Davis I came across Keith Jarrett, and from Jarrett, ECM. The bulk of my CD collection now (aside from Doctor Who audio adventures, and box sets of radio comedies) is from ECM.

I've been thinking about writing this blog for quite some time now. It's not easy.

I felt like those braxton hicks had pestered me on a daily basis.

My husband through all of this was incredible. By now I was unbearably hot so I had him drenching a washcloth in ice water, and then laying it with some ice chips on my head and neck.

I had warned him I didn’t want that, so as I pushed (with my eyes closed) I started frantically waving for him to stop. According to him, I whacked him pretty hard!! Still, having him there, knowing

The last blog I will mention is as different from the Alcatraz blog as day is from night. It is not about a single episode, is not academic writing, engages the reader, and was mainly composed in my head. Needless to say, I had a lot of fun with The Excuses You’ve Been Waiting For, and I have to credit all of the inspiration from a single episode of Untold Stories of the ER. With this blog, I felt like I finally had developed a voice that could be critical but funny, engaging but still informative. It also provided me with an excuse to keep watching Make it or Break it.

Another negative thing was that some of the prices are up there. My shrimp and grits were $18. I don't know if they have a choice, since there were a lot of shrimp in that puppy. The good thing is that it was as rich as all get out (we literally went walking around a mountainside afterwards to work it off), and you could easily share it with someone, add a side of cornbread, and you're good. We ended up bringing almost all the gumbo home.

It’s because Apple’s advertisements seem to cater to hipsters; they use indie music in their commercials as well. And since hipsters are all about being hip, and Apple is all about being hip, they’re the perfect couple.

When you're trying to get pregnant, you start to take a lot more notice of your body. You spend a lot of time with your gaze firmly focussed on the internal as you monitor your temperature, note any physical symptoms out of the ordinary and hope with all your heart your mind isn't just making it all up. And then ... you get your period right on time, as per usual.

But over the past 30+ years, conservatives have begun to define religious freedom specifically as protecting Christians against the gross infringment of other religions and beliefs upon their precious moral values (too snarky?). While it's true that around 75% of Americans consider themselves Christians, we are still a country of laws, and not a theocracy. Therefore, while we decry Saudi Arabia and other countries around the world who have theocratic regimes, the moral majority, Christian conservative right, still push harder and harder to make Christian moral values the values of our whole country, even going as far as changing laws to comply with Christian morality.
The national media has been quick to pick up on this story and has been decidedly anti-Petrino (a quick Google search on ‘Bobby Petrino’ will confirm this). Perhaps neither of those facts is very surprising—our culture (and by extension, the media) is always interested in a juicy story about the misdeeds or failure of public figures, and Bobby Petrino has never been very popular with the media anyway (ESPN’s Pat Forde has been on a personal crusade against him for years).

I had a sister born on this day and the Girl Scouts in my home town Mt Vernon Illinois decided to adopt the first baby born on this special day.

The Brazilian real has been trading in a narrow band in recent weeks around BRL1.80 to BRL1.83 to the U.S. dollar. According to Delfim Netto, that level means the real is “overvalued by 25% to 30%, putting our industry at a great disadvantage against competitors.”
But be careful if you want to follow my example (do a backup before you use Master builds), I can’t tell whether we really have a general good quality in Master or whether I only was luck selecting the builds I tested.

This is a question that people keep asking me. If it is important to the people of Barpool ward then it is important to me that they know the true figure.
Well… in the case of Plan Nine From Outer Space, it’s the sheer, willful, almost GLEEFUL way Ed Wood ignored every facet of the production. Writing. Continuity. Acting. Direction. These were all secondary to “Getting the movie made” and that showed in every frame. When Bela Lugosi died during filming, he merely hired his dentist to walk around with a cape over his face and simply believed nobody would notice. Scenes change from Night to Day to Night depending on what angle he’s shooting from. It’s a train wreck. It’s really, really bad.
It is my personal opinion that approximately 99% of citizens couldn’t give a sincere and serious flying fuck about solving the alleged problems they complain about. They are only interested in whining like goddamn fucking 13 year old spoilt brats who have not been brought up by an adult mother or father.

Yet many of us including myself have grown up with the subconscious idea—which now seems solely faithlessly idiotic and obnoxious to everything but oneself—that prayer is a one-sided dialogue. In our means of justifying this belief, we claim that God does not directly speak to us, and that our only method of receiving God’s response is by waiting for direct and physical results—we wait for God to change or advance our lives toward riches and blessings.
This is often a mistake made by new business start-ups who in the heat of battle forget that the experience they create for their customers is the most impressionable and lasting investments they can make.

Have I missed anybody out? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like Captain Kirk assembling the first crew of the Starship Enterprise... "to boldly go where no man has gone before".
Right then, here are some my samples (as seen on TV) lol.... some were shown in more detail on TV, but at the end of the day, for me, the kudos is being on the Design Team in the first place whether or not they get picked out to be looked at specifically!
For the high-density inner cities of course, Von Rectangle envisaged multi-story car parks towering high above the ring roads and pedestrian precincts, where people would find easily-accessible ample car parking spaces amongst the concrete pillars and supports that would bring a bright new futuristic sheen to their car parking experience under the florescent lights of a throbbing metropolis. A place where the air would always be fresh and the high-speed lifts would whisk people from the parking decks down to the pedestrian shopping paradises at ground level. Or, if people preferred, they could take a leisurely stroll down the bright well-lit stairwells and delight in meeting and passing the time of day with all manner of interesting people as they passed each other on those stairs.

Like several of the books on the top shelf, this one has gotten a tremdous amount of use in the 20+ years I've owned it. While I try to avoid splattering anything that's going to cause pages to stick together, there's no denying that there's a significant amount of foods garnishing several dozen pages in the book. It's a beautiful, fairly large, well-bound volume, so I don't have the problem I have with New Basics where the pages are actually falling out, but it does show some wear, and this should only be considered a compliment to Julia. This one belongs in every chef's library.
Why is the junta going after Cissé? I can’t say, but they’ve been targeting him for some time; let’s recall that armed men ransacked his home on the very first night of the coup.

Good morning! Hope alls well, its been a busy week for me but manageable. Does anyone wake up feeling like you need more than 24 hours to a day? I swear most days lately I feel this way.....I have had those kinds of days where it seems every minute of every hour is virtually accounted for and I am craving desperately a few days to do absolutely nothing! So I actually am listening to my own body and mind and am going to be away for a few days, taking a little break and getting away for some much needed R and R...so this post will have to suffice until Monday. I will wish you all now the happiest Mothers day possible....may it be one filled with much love, happiness, peace and above all relaxation! Would love to know what everyones up to for your special day!
If you've ever seen the movie Airplane!, just picture the scenes where all of the passengers next to Ted Striker are committing suicide to get away from his constantly moving mouth, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Andy and I were pantomiming shooting ourselves in the head, hanging ourselves with a rope, drinking straight gasoline, lighting ourselves on fire, and trying to throw ourselves out of the tiny airplane window. Anything to get away from this awful, awful human being.
I do not care for any race obsessed groups; not kkk, black panthers, la raza, etc. I think business and political groups based on race or ethnicity are not helpful in the pursuit of a free country. And problematic to the evolution of a better society and peaceful culture.

“While Apple and Samsung have taken it in turns to lead the smartphone market over the last four quarters, it seems as if Samsung may now have established a firm lead in this space, shipping 11.8 million more units than the Cupertino, California company in Q1,” Juniper said in a statement today.
“To the grade Illuminated Minerval were admitted those Minervals who in the judgment of their superiors were worthy of advancement. Elaborate initiatory ceremonies fixed in the candidate’s mind the notions that the progressive purification of his life was to be expected as he worked his way upward in the order, and that the mastery of the art of directing men was to be his special pursuit as long as he remained in the new grade. To accomplish the latter, i.e., to become an expert psychologist and director of men’s consciences, he must observe and study constantly the actions, purposes, desires, faults, and virtues of the little group of Minervals who were placed under his personal direction and care. For his guidance in this difficult task a complicated mass of instructions was furnished him.
Anyway... here ya go. Let me know if you try it and how it works for you.
... it is not a God who is responsible for the evil and imperfection of the world, because the world we experience is the creation of our own ignorance, our own cravings and passions. That imperfection should come out of perfection and completeness seems to contradict all reason, while the opposite appears more likely to the Buddhist. The experiences of life and the examination of those who attained enlightenment have taught him that from a state of imperfection, perfection can be achieved, and the sufferings resulting from our passions are the very forces that lead toward liberation.To overcome our self-imposed suffering, the Buddha tells us, we have to purge ourselves of certain natural but harmful tendencies of mind and emotions -- something like Christianity's seven deadly sins. Releasing the grip of self-defeating tendencies means keeping a tight rein on every aspect of behavior. He calls it the Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

EXTRA TIP Did you know that baby carrots we buy in the grocery store aren't 'young' carrots or even 'small' carrots at all? Instead, they are commercial carrots that start with huge carrots that are ground into the bullet-shaped carrots credited with increasing carrot consumption by manyfold in the last decade or so. Like many, I like them for snacking. But when it comes to cooking carrots, choose whole carrots. The trimming and peeling process will take a few minutes but for real carrot flavor, there's no comparison.
He lay before me, sated and happy, but I could focus on nothing but the tingling in my clit, still alive with energy from the friction of rubbing against his stomach as I rode him earlier. I began to laugh through the tears. ‘I’m sorry my love, but I was wrong. I NEED to cum!’ He just smiled again, and I rolled onto my back as he lowered his magic tongue between my thighs, his hands on my nipples again. Despite the intensity of my desire, the first orgasm still took some coaxing, but when it arrived it lifted me up in deep waves of pleasure, seeming to radiate through every muscle in my body. He paused, giving me about half a minute to recover, then licked me into a shorter but still delicious second set of climaxes, then after a slightly longer pause, my favourite third set, always shorter but sweet and pure, light, bliss…

I’m not a neuroscientist, but I’ve always been fascinated by things like expert systems, heuristics, and emergent properties in complex systems. Occasionally I’ll paint something with a clear neuro theme because it’s the clearest and most concise approach to my fascination with all of those “complexity” driven subjects. I have created ink drawings like “Biology of an Idea”, colored drawings like “Orbits of Joy”, and “Learning Circuit” (from left to right, below) and paintings like “Dendritic Echoes” and “Neural Network”.

In the past I have always seen advertisements for schemes such as Global Challenge and immediately had the thought that anything with the word ‘global’ in it was without a doubt beyond my capabilities. Yet, after disbelievingly reading several times through an email sent direct to my inbox from the Moth’s main office, I discovered that I had been offered the position of Media Intern with the Moth this summer. Now I’m off to New York, hardly a week after my exams finish, to experience the biggest opportunity of my life so far. I could never have achieved this without the support of the University’s Careers and Employability Centre – we’re very lucky to have them!

As for me, I think I’m going to play the field for a while and get to know a few of the dogs on my street before committing to another dog myself. I’ll see if I can’t make friends with the new puppy next door and dog-sit once in a while. After all, it’s nice when they visit, but it can be just as nice when they go home!
If you have any views on this, be it book and beer pairings or on the subject its self i'd love to hear about it as this is a relitivly new subject in the blogging world, but at one point or another I'm sure we've all been guilty of sitting in a pub or at home with a nice pint and book to chill out with. Cheers.

Granny and Mama liked to read, too, and we often ran into the difficulty of sharing a new book. When we discovered the story of Toby Tyler, we were all enthralled with the tale, and would take turns reading it. When one of us would lay it down, another would quickly pick it up and get lost in the story. I remember the joy we shared as we talked over the characters in the book, and anticipated what would happen next. I was delighted to find a copy of the old book in excellent condition at a yard sale a few years ago.
Yesterday's playgroup went pretty well. Matthew barfed on the carpet but the hostess was really cool about it. There were a lot of kids there. Three other infants aged 5-9 months that were all girls, so Matthew had his pick ;-) And there were quite a few preschoolers as well. Turns out one of the ladies there is close friends with Sam's french teacher. Small world. We talked about all things parenting and it was nice. I was the oldest mother there, something I'm noticing all over the place. It feels weird but it is what it is.
The 80's gave us Prince and Boy George, but thankfully that little ol' band from Texas was able to kick their ass, along with a blaze of blues known as Stevie Ray Vaughn. But both Texas legends were throwbacks to an earlier era with ZZ Top being a solidly 70's originating band, while Boy George was a throwback to, to. . . to what, I'm not sure. A failed sex-experiment somewhere in Sweden with a couple of transgenders on LSD?
It is said that in his earlier years, Ritchie would physically restrain people from jumping off the cliff, like when he once tackled a man on the edge of a cliff to prevent him from killing himself, while his wife called the police. However, as he got older, he would simply offer distraught people at the edge of the Gap a cup of tea and someone to talk to.

‘So who did it? Who’s behind all this?’ Ollie’s mum was wearing one of those expressions he’d seen on teachers when they were hell bent on finding a culprit, so he looked away because not making eye contact obviously meant you were innocent. His eyes drifted to the iPod and its still glowing screen.
The movie is in 3-D, but if you are looking to save some cash I think the film would be just as fabulous in 2-D. I’m kind of over the whole 3-D fad and most movies, The Avengers included, just do not use the technology enough to make it worth the extra charge at the ticket booth. The special effects are great, but do not hinge on the use of 3-D.

2. To step off noisy Gaushala (the name means "Cow shelter") and enter the gates of Dwarika's heritage hotel is to truly experience another city within the city. Dwarika Das Shrestha devoted his life to collecting the intricate hand-carved wooden pieces being discarded by Kathmandu's modern property developers, not knowing what he'd ever do with them, but sensing their innate value. His hobby eventually became this hotel, which doubles as a museum for Newar art heritage. The complex manages to be enormous and intimate simultaneously, and each room feels individually appointed and hand-crafted.

Paper: Times & Season by Echo Park - sweet stripes & fancy free inked with Cherry Cobbler ink
I’m an American. I was born in Appleton, Wisconsin 22 years ago in the middle of winter. In the 22 years that I have been living I have seen and experienced parts of life that no one will ever get to see. In 22 years I have lived through 8,030 days and within those days I’ve lived through 192,720 hours. Break that down into minutes, then seconds, and then you can see how much time we actually spend on this earth.
Now all grown up, returning to Krabi had left a complete different feeling in me once more. It's still beautiful, full of lush green forests, crystal clear blue sea and perfect soft white sand. Just the way I remember it. Can you imagine yourself sinking your toes into the white soft sand right now?

Peeps were trying to revive the obviously dead corpse, and while walking at the pace of a land turtle back to my own scooter, I realized something.

Nonetheless, a good animation is a good animation regardless of the soundtrack. This is a very dark, gothic animated video that would probably never be shown on actual TV. I am reminded of Nightmare Before Christmas / Corpse Bride a bit, but with cell animation instead of stop-motion animation.

How one day the decision to love a little girl gave way to the pell- mell, rumble-tumble feeling of actually falling in love with her--so thankful.
That’s where you can let things out of your unconscious that you might have not realized.
It's pretty easy for me to relate to that line. Is it the fact that I was raised in a pastor's family, being uprooted and transferred every three to five years, allowing me enough time to get fully adjusted to a new home just in time to move again? Is it because I have a traveling spirit and can't stay in one place too long without feeling the need to go somewhere else? Is it because I've spent significant amounts of time in other countries, and would like to consider myself one of those so-called "global citizens"? I guess it's all of the above. Having parents who live in another country (or this fall, when between the four members of our family, we were on three separate continents) definitely helps the feeling of not truly having a home.

Out of all the categories that comprise ‘serious violence’ which the British Crime Survey considers in its report, domestic violence has the highest percentage, 45%, of repeat victimisation, and repeat victimisation accounts for 73% of all incidents of domestic violence. In the majority of incidents of domestic violence the victims were women i.e. 85%.

Caleb’s daughter Aksah had been given some land, but if her field was to be as productive as possible, she needed a water source too. Do you just ask God for the bare minimum or do you ask him for the best? God doesn’t want you to just ‘get by’, he wants you to feel free to ask for the very best from him.
Because now I see that sometimes when I am sitting at the kitchen table and painting pictures with my girls and sometimes when I am sitting in the family room and watching Disney Princess Sing-A-Longs and getting totally caught up in Mulan's heartwrenching Reflection song (can I hug her? I want to hug her) - something clicks. And I hear my character's voices. Maybe even just a a sentence or two, and maybe I jump up to write them down, or maybe I just let them continue to sit and sink in and become the glue that my story has so desperately been needing.

For a lot of writers, this is a major source of anxiety. For as long as you can remember, your book has been your own. The only people who’ve read it have been people on your side: writer colleagues in your critique group, your friends, your spouse, your kids, your agent, your editor. People who want to like your book because they like you, or because they believe strongly in the book and its potential contribution to children’s literature.

This is my favourite. The beer is one of my all time favourites as well but in this case I mean the element of cleverness that I have employed to squeeze this brew into the Movembeer Movement. Pilsner Urquell is the first pilsner. Ever. It was brewed in 1842 in the town of Plzen in what is now The Czech Republic. Back then the region was known as Bohemia – hence Matilda Bay’s Bohemian Pilsner – and it sat quietly in the kingdom of Morovia. The English translation of Urquell is ‘source’ as in the beginning, therefore Pilsner Urquell is the original. From Morovia. Morovian Original. How good’s THAT!?
A little over a year ago, I spoke about change permeating my life and the visceral response it can elicit when I’m faced with it. And while I have grown, learned and benefited from many of these changes, the onset of them always starts out the same: with angst, fear and a feeling of impending loss.

Texture is another draw. During the winter I crave a silky, creamy texture, like Shiseido’s Benefiance WrinkleResist24 Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam. During the spring and summer I’m drawn to something light and fluffy, like Lancôme Creme Mousse Confort Comforting Creamy Foaming Cleanser (hello mouthful).

Pharmacists are the most accessible health care providers. Pharmacists can provide basic health screenings for blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Many community pharmacists are trained to give flu, pneumonia, and shingles immunizations. Pharmacists are trained to triage many patient self-care needs and if asked can provide recommendations for treatment that prevent a trip to the doctor. More patients are educating themselves about the services that pharmacists provide but many are unaware of the disease state management services pharmacists provide.
It's the largest commonly available, because U.S. sporting arms regulations generally limit modern smokeless powder cartridge firing rifles to .50 caliber or below (there are a few exceptions), and also because more powerful weapons generally generate too much recoil and muzzle blast to be fired from the shoulder, and need to be mounted into the ground or on a vehicle.

Harry had a hard day at the office and needed to unwind with a kiddie cocktail. He was horrified, by the way, when he discovered this drink was made with 7-Up. "Soda?" he sputtered wiping his tongue.

Maybe a difficult project at work can lead to additional responsibility or knowledge you may not have found before. Plans that fall through with friends just mean you have to keep trying harder to show your friends and loved ones that you won’t bail on them after one failed hangout attempt.

Other reactions I had were more personal. There is a poem in the collection by Fleur Adcock, who visited the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle when I was there.

I remember that she was quite a glamorous-looking lady, but she got everybody’s name wrong in her presentation address. She must be getting on a bit by now.

The flame of liberty’s torch is no longer just slowly being extinguished. Each day brings new Executive Orders, new laws, new regulations, each more ominous than the last. Corruption in our government and our financial markets is rampant. The disease of dependency is infecting every layer of society. America is dying. We need an army of citizens, motivated and committed, to restore liberty in America, to breathe new life, new vibrancy into a nation on life support. We will not return our nation’s vitality with lawyers. We will not be prescribed the cures for our ailments by opportunistic politicians pedaling the latest edition of What Will It Take to Buy Your Vote. We simply will not. America is on the brink of flatlining.

She’s the center of the love triangle. Literally the center of everyone’s eyes. True this makes her a bit of a pawn…but I think because she’s so much like her mother it torments Heathcliff a bit. And you know that man deserves a bit of torture…Catherine (1) did promise to haunt him from the grave. Little did Heathcliff know it would be her living daughter. Not that this will save Catherine (2). Nope, it’s just firmly cementing her as a tool for Heathcliff.
But only right now.
It is all fixed now and I am trying to play catch up now. I hope everyone has been having a wonderful summer.

The urban scenario thus outlined—imagining a "future timber and plantation industry" stretching "throughout London, and beyond"—is like something out of Roger Deakin's extraordinary book Wildwood: A Journey Through Trees (previously described here) or even After London by Richard Jeffreys.

Our perspective is deeper and grows from an emotional and instinctive relationship with our people and our territory than the “Castes”. It is more profound than rationalising or adopting an artificial blueprint for a Utopian world because it grows from natural, human instinct.
So here are the two items of inspiration, which also came with tutorials.

Although Duffy labels Pole’s historical perspective in one place as “distinctive,” it actually seems quite conventional—at least regarding the apologetic use of history and the turmoil resulting from disobedience to God (182). Duffy recognizes this, noting elsewhere that the “invective against Protestantism as a socially destructive force is pervasive in Marian writing,” even apart from Pole’s influence (72). Indeed, Catholic apologist John Christopherson writes “‘that the olde mens saying was herein verified, that when the Antichrist should come, the rootes of the trees shulde growe upwarde’”—a metaphor that evangelical reformer William Tyndale used against the papists in his Practice of Prelates decades earlier (72; see Tyndale, Works II, 273). Even English evangelicals attempted to root their religion in the English past, and—with a Protestant twist—they claimed that allegiance to the pope would bring societal disarray.

XL: “It’s an honor really. I’m very proud of being mentioned alongside Linkin Park when people talk about Rap/Rock. When it’s all said and done, I want Xtatic Line to be remembered as one of the biggest acts that represented the genre. As far as pressure goes, I don’t do music to live up to others standards. I don’t make music and then go compare it to someone else’s work to determine if it’s good or not. I don’t put that kind of pressure on me because I don’t believe in that. So being compared to LP is fine due to the fact that I’m not trying to fill their shoes or live up to their name. I work on what I think would be interesting to try and create, and as long as I keep doing that, I’ll feel no exterior pressure.”
Common wisdom said a shade rose for every one of her folk killed in cursed Nazerak (and uncommon wisdom whispered that no new babe was born to her folk until a shade was killed.) These dark cousins, confined to shadow by the poisonous touch of the red sun’s rays, were demented creatures and evil mirrors of their once living twins. Legends of their cunning and brutality made them the most feared of Nazerak’s inhabitants. Myths told of a time before recorded history, when the world was uninhabitable, and her progenitors had to fight and hide deep in the bowels of the earth beneath their city while the shades hunted them for cruel sport.

We continued up 5th Avenue from there. I did a little shopping on the street, we went to Bergdorf's where a cute, sparkly, cat handbag cost only $4,500. We went into Trump Tower and FAO Schwarz. We continued back around to Times Square and ended our day together by eating at Ray's Pizza before he dropped me off at my hotel.

The next time somebody looks at you funny or makes a patronizing remark when you say you’re a writer, just smile and nod. They’ll get it someday. They’ll realize why you spent so much time tinkering with that oversized Word document once your novel is published.
The world has advice for those aging: lose weight, change the diet, increase activity, color the grays, moisturize the wrinkles, and for heaven's sake, get into a Zumba class. If a part fails you, replace it with titanium, and for the love of Pete, take your pills. In the same breath we are reminded to plan our funerals lest our loved ones be burdened with the task of interning us six feet under. We are encouraged to make all the arrangements, and for all practical purposes, stand next to the hole for the final years so when we do keel over we fall right in. Perhaps we should change the Corporal Works of Mercy by removing "bury the dead" and adding "bury yourself so the living don't have to be bothered".
Over the next few weeks I will be asking several authors why they chose to self publish and how they set about it, how they rate their success, the pitfalls of self-publishing and more besides.

It brings tears to my eyes, sometimes, when I see how much you’ve grown in how short a time. In a week you’ll be nine months old. You’ll have spent as much time outside of me as you did inside. It almost hurts for me to realize that because it means you’ve been everyone else’s for almost as long as you were just mine. I whined a lot when I was pregnant about how uncomfortable it was and how tired I felt, but the truth of it is that I miss that time we had to be just mommy and baby. Just us in our own little cocoon. Sharing everything. Drawing strength from the same food and having the same blood flow through our veins. It was so special to me.
I have really missed blogging but like all of you I have been really busy.
However, there is one (generic) process that can read the log files – and that’s ANY process that has to handle data blocks. And that’s really why I wrote this note in the first place. If a process finds at any time that the buffer it’s looking at in memory is corrupt it may do real-time block recovery if it thinks the corruption has occurred between the moment the block was read from disk and the present. There are various flags and details in the buffer header that tell it that the block is dirty (differs from what’s on disk) and the redo block address (RBA) where the earliest known change to the in-memory block can be found in the log files.
LÄPPLE: In those years the liturgical movement stressed the centrality of the liturgy for Christian life, and aimed to rediscover the essential elements of the liturgy, freeing them from the additions that had deposited over the centuries. Josef Pascher, the professor of Pastoral Theology, was also the director of the Georgianum, the college where the students resided, and he was an enthusiastic supporter of the liturgical movement. He had been influenced by the French currents and in the debate that then began between those who stressed in the mass the theory of the sacrifice and those instead who stressed that of the supper, Pascher was part of the latter group. Romano Guardini had, instead, already expressed himself
Yes, Arnie, we are rigidly wedded to such dogma as balanced budgets, living within your means, being friendly to businesses and jobs and prosperity, and not chasing every really stupid far-left idea that comes down the pike -- like gay marriage, global warming, laws enforcing transgender equality, what Sacto considers a proper diet, and what propaganda should be included in school textbooks. Really solving California's problems would include a major decrease in spending, reigning in the public sector unions who are strangling the state, lowering taxes and less red tape -- all of which you failed miserably to do.

As I began Need You More by Beth Wiseman I was completely unfamiliar with the author and outside of a very brief synopsis the story itself. The story takes place in Round Top, a very small rural Texas town, and centers on the family that has just re-located there from the city. While initially Brad, Darlene, and their children appear to be the “perfect” family, that facade will quickly begin to fade away as issues appear that neither Mom/Dad nor Husband/Wife could have imagined.

You are an unwilling visitor to a country whose language you do not speak. You know very little about the place and don’t know if the part you are stuck in is characteristic of the country as a whole. You might be on an island the size of Bali or in a country the size of Siberia. Via and interpreter you are told that the only way out is to hire a car, but before you can do that, you have to pass a written test which shows you know the local road rules.

Also in Nouakchott, journalists gathered outside the office of the Director General of Security and issued a statement condemning the abuse directed towards members of their profession by police. Recent assaults include one against the editor of the French language independent Mauritanian news website fr.AlAkhbar.info, who was battered and detained by police while covering a protest a few days ago.
On his return he offered me first, the half pint glass. Mmm lovely. He obviously put the beers in the wrong glasses. This was a delightful 8% Allagash - Flexus 2011French Style Farmhouse Ale. This would do very nicely for a start. However, I was soon to learn that this was his first choice and my beer was indeed in my third pint glass. Wow- absolutely gorgeous. He knows me so well.

Speaking of icky complications, Ben has finally succumbed to the stomach bug and has been doing the required tossing of cookies and running of fever and lying about involved with said bug. I maintain hope that it will yet pass me by. Like many people, I harbor a huge aversion to throwing up. I don't care if I will feel better right after, I don't like the right before or the during. That's a 2/3 majority for dislike.
only a few of them will really miss you, only a few really want to look in your eyes until the very last moment, and say goodbye with a smile. those are the ones whose memory will keep you company when you’ll be sad or bored; those are the ones you’ll want to meet, once back, to share not your travel stories, but your travel emotions with.
For this week over at My Paper Craft World..the Cooking With Cricut challenge this week is for National Card & Letter Writing Month.

I'm still waiting to hear the results from the interview, so I figured I should fill in the story behind this potential move. Because even if this opportunity doesn't work out, that won't be the end, I'm going to keep looking. It makes me sad to type that- unlike nearly everyone else I know, I like working for a big law firm. I genuinely like my job and I like the people I work with. But, for reasons outside my control, both of those statements are changing. And I think it's my responsibility to own my career and make changes before I become a victim of it.
Rising taste? I wondered, was that the same as good taste? Was it a way of achieving good taste? Was that site perhaps telling people that if they want good taste, then they should read Shadow of a Doubt? Was my blog now right up there with classical music, William Shakespeare, Chippendale furniture, and white Christmas tree lights? At long last, the aesthetes had discovered me!
Well, how could I not try that? So, I scrounged around in my fridge and discovered the base for my first leftover challenge attempt: Mom’s meatloaf. I’ll tell you, it looks a little gross (cause leftover loaves of cold ground meat often do), but my mother’s meatloaf is probably second only to my own (I’m very, very proud of my meatloaf!) So this makes for a pretty delicious leftover.
More later, but for now a couple of videos to show the difference. First up is a recording from 1971 of Buddy Rich's band playing "Straight no chaser" which could have come from the 1950s
This guy looks altogether more suave: dark KlevereTien is the James Bond of Belgian winter ales (you can put that on the label, Hobbybrouwerij Het Nest, but I want credit). "Black and Strong" it says: the latter can't be argued with at 10% ABV, though it's more a red-brown than properly black. The head subsides quickly leaving just a ring of foam around the edge of a dark mirror surface which sparkles faintly.

By the time Good Old War came on, the front of the venue got crowded. Good Old War fans are fiercely loyal, and the band responded with a very fan-friendly set. They played a lot of their first record, “Only Way to be Alone,” which is the fan favorite and the record that defines what the band tries to do in all of their other records. That being said, the greatest tracks of the evening were the earth-shatteringly beautiful “Amazing Eyes” and “Weak Man,” which featured an incredible bluesy guitar solo by Dan Schwartz.
Spread mayo on both sides of bread. Put about 3 pieces of bok choy leaves, a few slices of tomato and 2 slices of cheese on sandwhich. I also put a vegetarian chicken patty on mine, which is shown in the pictures.
There are a few additional steps involved in making this recipe compared to traditional brownies. The brownie batter itself is pretty standard, but instead of baking it all at once, half is added to the pan and baked, then once it cools briefly, the caramel is poured on top and then covered with the remaining half of the brownie batter. Here's the thing - the recipe actually call for melting down store-bought caramel candies with heavy cream for the caramel layer. I decided to try subbing my leftover salted caramel sauce instead and while the brownies were tasty, they were sort of a mess. It was nearly impossible to spread the brownie batter over the sauce so instead those two layers were essentially swirled together. It took much longer for the brownies to bake and the caramel bubbled out the sides quite a bit and left me trying to chisel the brownies out of the pan.
The unfashionableness of Der Freischütz in England is a little baffling. In its day, not only was the opera celebrated across Germany, it soon conquered other European stages and indeed theatres worldwide. Premiered at the Berlin Schauspielhaus in 1821, by the end of the decade it had already received productions in Danish, Swedish, Czech, Russian, English, French, Hungarian, Polish and Dutch, and by 1850, stagings had been mounted as far afield as Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro, and Sydney. Of course, it is in many ways the quintessential German Romantic opera, though one should always remember how much influence other ‘national’ traditions wield over it, but it is saddening that we, or at least the powers that be, should apparently evince so little interest in this tradition. Oberon was programmed to appear this season at Covent Garden, a mouthwatering prospect, only to be cancelled in favour of yet another run – within the same season! – for La traviata. The only staging of Der Freischütz I have seen in London, or indeed elsewhere, was that by ENO in 1999. Meanwhile, Calixto Bieito has just presented a new production in Berlin for the Komische Oper, a must-see staging by all accounts. Perhaps ENO, with its reinvigorated interest in co-productions will bring it across the Channel at some point; we can but hope. Many thanks, in any case, are due to the LSO for this concert performance.

In the workshop James shared stories of writing and publishing and we looked at different aspects of writing Thrillers, such as pace, weaving clues and even script-writing. Now you may not be a 'Thriller' writer, but to me, all good novels must have thrilling moments.
One of the key concerns mentioned in the document is the extension of involvement in the Nile Basin Initiative beyond the state – that is, to include a wide range of society. In the process to date, and the wider construction of new political environments, the main actors in the NBI have worked at the state level. Two key issues arising out of this process are first, how to incorporate the visions and beliefs of society at all levels within this wider basin vision in order to ensure that ownership has both depth and breadth; and second, how to ensure that non-state, civil society actors also have a voice in the kinds of program that are being established.
Its also what Anderson himself called PDL in interviews. Critics often read this as implying that the star had been molded into an art house formula, but really Punch-Drunk Love is an exercise in Anderson’s own reinvention of the pre-existing genre conventions in which Sandler thrived.
It's the last day of 2011. Tomorrow we'll start afresh with 2012 and leave this entire year behind us, a bundle of memories with dusts swirling at its feet. I spent yesterday clicking through every month's posts for this entire year and (probably influenced by a recent end-of-the-season episode where they essentially just piece together clips from all the episodes of that season) decided that I wanted to share with you my favorite moments in Brooketopia in 2011. Enjoy!
And you probably don't either. There is something about us. We have an amazing strength to smile again, to get up, to live life, to laugh... and still right there, just below the surface we have them there... with us. Be it a child we held in our arms, a heartbeat we saw on a screen or a dream we had when we saw those two lines on a pregnancy test. We remember. We never forget. We never will. We are their mothers. The one who loved them first and we will love them still until we take our last breaths and join them once again.
I.e., had Claire shown up with reinforcements in the nick of time and saved him before he'd been put through such pain and suffering....well, then it would have been a nice, heart-warming story in which Hero and Heroine conquer evil and ride off into the sunset together. But it wouldn't have half the power of a story in which Jamie and Claire _truly_ conquer _real_ evil, and thus show what real love is. Real love has real costs--and they're worth it.

The first couple of weeks were pleasantly chaotic, getting ourselves organised, getting to know people, finding our way around, making first friendships. One of the organisational things which had to be done was the election of representatives of First Arts to the Students Union. There was some kind of address from the Union people in Theatre L, the largest of the lecture theatres, after a history lecture, and people interested in being candidates were invited to speak to the gathered multitude. Nobody was taking the whole affair all that seriously and there was a considerable buzz of conversation among the couple of hundred students assembled. Suddenly a strange, freakish figure gambolled up to the microphone and announced excitedly,

The only biological grandfather I'd known, I lost in elementary school. But I always had Papa Jack. He wasn't my biological grandfather, but he was my grandfather just the same. We celebrated holidays with him and Mama Jack. We learned to swim in their pool and spent most days of the summer there. Papa Jack and Mama Jack bought me my first (and only) cabbage patch doll. My first bike. The watch I really wanted, even though my sister told me it was a stupid gift to ask for for Christmas. They took care of us. They made sure we had enough. Enough gifts at Christmas, Easter baskets on Easter Sunday (I remember asking my mom one year, "How does the Easter Bunny always know to take our baskets there?"), enough love. Always enough love.

How can I get to know the bits of myself which I deny? The first step was realising that such bits exist in the first place. When I first saw Johari’s Window in the 1990s, it did not really speak to me. It was a great revelation to realise, in about 2000, that I lie to myself because I want to see myself as a Good person. One thing I sought to do then was find other motivations I might have to lie to myself.

Once again, the wine charges in and smashes the place up. This is my favourite wine style in the world. I often have it with fish, but here the acidity once again just creates noise. The beer fares a little better - there's the beginnings of a herby matching of flavours. But I'm not blown away. A narrow beer victory for me, and a total split in the room.

The evening the first snow falls, their mood unaccountably changes. In a moment of tenderness, the pair are surprised to find themselves building a snowman – or rather a snow girl – together.

And how to explain the little but very human tracks Mabel finds at the edge of their property?

The question is whether or not these lyrical activities are somehow different from the background design. Does a so-called “human mark” have any more purchase in a painting than a programmed or machined one? Are not Monzon’s human marks still made with a brush, just like the surfaces of his found designs? Is Monzon expressing himself in spite of rules and order (humanity atop rigorous design) or can we just say that everything on Monzon’s surfaces is equivalent, that all is surface, that all the colors and shapes fall in the so called trap of representation where there is nothing really human but there is instead just a performance inside of a system that does not allow true humanity or any further thoughts on what it means to be one. Maybe that is all being a human is, fooling yourself into thinking that you are unique or expressive (you find this latter belief in the paintings of Sarah Morris for example where design is all encompassing and, though intuitively arrived at, is pervasive and overbearing).

And the short answer is that part of the foundation for keeping and bearing arms rests in laws that lend order to nature. These are laws that God ordained and implemented just as certainly as he implemented and ordained the moral law (the 10 Commandments). This point is worth explaining because it’s fundamental to an understanding of how our inalienable rights flow to us from God rather than from government. As such, the foundation of those rights transcends government, which is why the right to keep and bear arms “shall not be infringed.”
The shops were closed, the fast food outlets were pulling down the shutters, taxi drivers congregated on the corners, hoping for passengers.
Parts of the country are already drier than they were in the summer of 1976, when Britain experienced its worst drought for more than 100 years. Then water shortages led to standpipes being installed on residential streets, water supplies to businesses being rationed and schools having to close early.

One would almost be led to believe that no one in America thought of black women as human beings until the first time white America saw The Unmistakable Her shed a tear on the Oprah Winfrey Show. It seemed there was a big huge gasp in the audience that day that sucked up all of the energy of more then a trillion tears shed over billions of years.
The lodge is classic rustic. The benches are the kind we all had to make in shop class in junior high. There's no fireplace but attached to a wall is a truly ancient pair of skiis. (Think 1x4s with leather straps.) And this lodge smells like homemade soup. Plus the cinnamon buns here? Whoa.
I did a little research and found that you can still get these but the price is higher. Target has them for the lowest price, around $25 online but I’d call before heading out to your local store to make sure they carry them and that the price is good. They were $44 at other stores online like walmart. Or wait for a yard sale, for some reason people like to get rid of these, little do they know how handy they can be!
I can't believe we'll be home in less than a month now! We can't wait to see everyone!!
In August 2005, Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (HGS) was granted a European patent over the gene and amino acid sequence for Neutrokine-alpha, a new polypeptide that is a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superligand family. The HGS scientists had identified the gene sequence for Neutrokine-alpha by bioinformatics (that is by using computational and statistical techniques to solve biological problems) rather than the standard route of a lab-based technique. As a result, HGS had speculated in the patent application as to the possible applications of the protein on the basis of what was already known about other members of the TNF family. Eli Lilly had brought opposition proceedings against the HGS patent at the European Patent Office (EPO) and launched revocation proceedings against the UK equivalent of the patent. Lilly claimed that the patent was invalid for lack of industrial application because HGS's predictions as to the activity of Neutrokine-alpha were speculative. HGS responded that, when the patent was applied for, other members of the TNF family had been shown to have industrial application.

Then it happened: one day last week he began to be a sincere participant in class. His comments were relevant and on point. After class I told him how much I appreciated his contributions. Then he took the unit test and scored decently on it, and he was proud of his accomplishment. Today they jigsawed articles about the 1930s in preparation to read To Kill A Mockingbird. The other students in his randomly chosen group looked at me, “Really, Ms. L? I have to work with him?” One of his group members has been begging me to send him to the office or kick him out of class all term. As they discussed their articles in their groups, Manuel started to expound on the Great Depression, the economy, Hoover, and Roosevelt. When I walked by he would stop me to corroborate a fact of his. I would agree with his fact, we would discuss it in front of the other group members, and I would move on. I watched him interact with his group, all of whom thought he was stupid. They were having a real and earnest discussion of what it must have been like to live back then. Circling around again, I heard the girl who is gleeful when he doesn’t show up to class ask, “How do you know so much about history?” She sounded a little awed. I rooted for him silently, “Prove your stuff, Manuel!”
Had Dunham’s stories not been held up as some sort of shining light in the sexist darkness of TV, I doubt anyone would have raised so much of a fuss. But it’s being told that she’s somehow a wonderful story of victory over adversity that leaves a bad taste. If the goal is to tell the stories of women in a way that’s different from what we’ve seen before, surely we could’ve chosen someone whose stories weren’t actually all that different at all, save for the biological sex of the people experiencing them.
And without further ado, here are the designs that caught my eye for capturing the essence of the 'Christmas in July' challenge ...

In 2002, Mumba was voted one of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World by the readers of FHM, and the adultery that spread in society led directly to earthquakes in Iran, off the coast of the Peru, and in the United States in June of that year.

For my card today, I embossed the white panel with the Spellbinders ES-001 So Trendy M-Bossabilities and popped it up on 3D Foam squares to mount it to the green base. The green flower is actually the S5-050 Rose Creations middle sized leaf fanned out into a flower shape. The sentiment is from the Hero Arts Happy Day Animals set.
I grew up in Canada, whose entire population, (about 30 million), is that of New York State — only ten percent of the U.S. Social, educational and professional circles are smaller and tighter and lies usually easier to detect. The best universities number no more than five, so soi-disant backstories are harder to create from whole cloth when a few phone calls or mouse clicks can reveal the truth.

Cute. Cute. Little baby.
Three weeks in a serviced apartment is not how I wanted to spend my holidays (or our money) but there is an indoor pool, I can walk to the shops, restaurants and cinemas and we have swimming lessons most days so I'm sure we'll keep busy and count down the days. The only downside is they can't give us a carpark during the daytimes so if I leave for the day they'll only give me a carpark at night. Again, cranky about it but accepted it.
Another week of completely Random Workouts, oh joy! Or is it…Geek check time X-Fit apes, obscure math concepts are involved here so to time to click away…Fractals, you read that right home-slice: fractals. So many times we are completely wrapped up in sets and reps, weight, time, programs, days of the week, body weight and anything else you can pin an absolute number or value to. We prefer chaos and a natural pattern to the world as we observe it. Like nature we try to follow the most simple and efficient path in training. Study up tonight and scour the inter-webs for more information…lord knows the last time you X-Fit apes actually picked up a “real” book to study?

In the spring, when ships sailed from land to land, Gunnlaug prayed King Ethelred for leave to sail somewhither; the king asks what he was about then. Gunnlaug said, “I would fulfil what I have given my word to do,” and sang this stave withal:—

Moshe received the Torah at Sinai and handed it to Yehoshu’a, Yehoshu’a to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets handed it on to the men of the Great Assembly. They said three things: Be careful in judgment, raise up many disciples, and make a fence for the Torah (Pirqei Avot, 1:1)

When tightrope day comes, your cold, stiff corpses will be swaying gently in the wind - not because we are blood-thirsty lunatics, but because you’ve designated yourselves to be the eager, willing assistants of a murderous genocide. As the lynch mob hauls your kicking, spasmodic carcasses up on that tree branch, you will hear the voices of a thousand victims of rape and murder sighing a collective sight of relief. For it is your wilful denials and execrable obfuscations that is lubricating this relentless urban & rural terrorism. It is your cynical lies and propaganda which is aiding and abetting the destruction of innocent lives. Your hands are stained with the blood of victims - it is their memory you wilfully defile, and for this, you will pay, one day.
Now, for my project, I debated for WEEKS with myself about whether I should go with Thanksgiving or Halloween, and I settled on Halloween, because I LOVE Halloween gift projects. Doing these before Halloween is not my customary, procrastinat-y style, so I feel a lot more organized than I must have been feeling when I accidentally ordered a SECOND Mini Milk Carton Big Shot die!
For most responsible men, once you tell them that you are pregnant, a sense of manhood and ownership takes control over us. It triggers our brains to get ready to become the provider that we are meant to be. It may take him a few days or even a week to get his brain together. But be there with him, as he will be there for you, and talk to him about everything you are thinking as far as theabout your future together. If you are worried about the money and all that keep this in mind, the military always looks out for family! They will help with medical for you and the baby, housing, etc. Also, if you do decide to work together on this and the military does help you guys out. They will also do this in the event he gets deployed, as long as you are living together and have proof that he is the father (paternity test). My advice for living together is to discuss moving in to basic housing, which is provided by the military, to make your living arrangements easier for the both of you.
The book “Prescription for Nutritional Healing” by James and Phyllis Balch lists aspartame under the category of “chemical poison.” While many still refuse to believe that toxic or otherwise health-harming ingredients would be allowed to be used in food manufacturing, the evidence against aspartame and other artificial sweeteners is, in my opinion, overwhelming…

I think I’ve thoroughly demilitarized this skirt. When I tell people this used to be a Marine Corps uniform skirt, they are always surprised. It looks decidedly un-military-like paired with a hot pink tank and black lace.
It was more like a slow burn than a spark, but I’d say I started working in earnest on the project in June 2009, researching possible science projects and brainstorming plot complications and scenes. I turned in my final draft in February 2011. The book was released in January 2012.
Now, there can be no good reason for Cambridgeshire Traffic Police to be calling me, so what was my reaction? I have no idea why but I said, very brightly "Oh, hello!" as though I had entered a competition to win a million pounds and this was the organisers calling to tell me I had won. Anyway, I flew straight down (luckily I was in time to get a flight that evening (and huge thanks go to the very kind man in the boarding queue who overheard my half a very tearful phone conversation and offered to drive me from Stanstead Airport to Cambridge)) and got in to Cambridge just before midnight. It was a horrible night. However...things are so much better now.
And I know that my grief is just a tiny fraction of what Dave and Laura are going through. They are two of the most beautiful people I've ever known, and this has truly shattered them. Grief is an individual journey, different for everyone, and as much as I love them both and want to walk this road beside them, I know that ultimately they need to walk it alone. Each in their own way, they need to figure out how to cope with this grief that they'll carry with them for the rest of their lives. They will, in time. They'll learn to cope. But time does not heal all wounds. This one is forever.

And the most distinguished 20th century Australian conservative surely deserves at least a brief mention. Sir Robert Menzies was Australia's longest serving Prime Minister (in the 1950s and 60s) and is noted for how few his "initiatives" were over all that time -- a truly heroic achievement for any politician, given the temptations to meddle and the pressures to "do something" that come at governments from all sides. Here is one excerpt from his thinking:
Cool the cake in the pan for 15 minutes, then unmold onto a rack to cool.
I have been enjoying the streamlined, delicious recipes from The Modern Baker. In fact I included the book as one of my favorites in my 2010 Cookbook Roundup and purchased three copies of the cookbook in hardcover: for me and for each of my daughters. If you don't have a copy, the book is now available at very reasonable cost in paperback! I was honored that Nick Malgieri recently sent a paperback copy of the book to each member of The Modern Baker Challenge.
The randomly drawn prize for this set of 10 sketches is worth over $200.00!!!!
The key ingredients to make both recipes are whole Roma tomatoes (Lidia says that canned are just as good). I used California grown San Marzano-Style tomatoes which are truly flavorful. Yes, I had Saffron. I buy it at Trader Joe's for a reasonable price (because it's a small amount). The saffron is to give a pretty golden color to the pasta. The sauce is super easy to make:

In the year or so since Mamata Banerjee has taken office her government has dealt in censorship, social and moral policing and random acts of legislation. She recently ordered all her party members to stop socialising with opposition members and in an expression of her horrible aesthetic sense has mandated that all public buildings in Kolkata be painted blue. Of more concern is her ‘suggestion’ that people watch entertainment channels on television rather than the news. She went a step further and proposed setting up a State newspaper and television channel which one party member described as being a ‘good idea to spread correct information’. This blatant distrust of the media only highlights her own insecurities regarding her rule in West Bengal. The latest controversy is her arrest of a college professor over a cartoon which portrayed her negatively. West Bengal clearly isn’t a ‘heaven of freedom’.

FH: They had lived nomadic lives - from when they had left university they had spent their lives travelling and they were lovely, interesting, open people. We lived just three days from where Saddam Hussein was bombing and one of my friends hid in a roof in Kuwait during one of the raids and was not discovered. The country itself interested me - the Sultan of Oman was deposed by his son - this son was educated in the UK and during his rule changed Oman from something biblical - girls were not educated at all in 1960, and boys, educated at Koranaic schools, had to leave the country if they wished to continue their education - to a modern state. I found this fascinating and read extensively about the country.

The Inspector General’s new 57 page report states the balkanized city court system in New Orleans would benefit from one less court and roughly half as many judges. This would save city government as much as $2.5 million by moving Traffic Court functions into Municipal Court, according to the report, which figured that six judges could do the work of the 12 who now sit on four separate benches- 1st City Court, Traffic Court, 2nd City Court, and Municipal Court.
Also- I have a dermatologist appt on the 19th. I found a black spot on my birthmark that is on my back. I am worried about it because I always "inspect" it to make sure it's not changing shape, color, size. The doctor is going to do a biopsy of it, please say a prayer for me. I am really worried.
The practical application requirement ensures that something which is a mere idea or discovery is not patented – it must be concrete and tangible. This requires some sort of manifestation or effect or change of character. However, it is important to remain focused on the requirement for practical application rather than merely the physicality of the invention. The language in Lawson must not be interpreted to restrict the patentability of practical applications which might, in light of today’s technology, consist of a slightly less conventional “change in character” or effect that through a machine such as a computer. Also there was this also-interesting interpretation of Bilski:
“It’s absolutely ridiculous,” said Grant Cardone, an LA-based business consultant whose video of birds being sucked into an engine of LA-bound Delta Flight 1063 on April 19 has become a TV and Internet sensation. The plane turned back and landed safely.

Admitting that their approach to recording is unconventional Cawte equates it to their success, “the people that latched onto us in the beginning liked the sound of house we’re trying to keep it like that, yet it’s not even the sound of the house it’s the sound of that feeling of someone sitting on the sofa playing something. If you’re in the front room you can relax into recording and stay up till whenever eating pizza in my underwear.”
You may have noted that the above scenario introduces up to 5 seconds of latency between the server knowing something and the client being informed on its next poll. Not the kind of performance we expect in a new application, surely! You try to reduce the timings lower, to give you better latency; now, this may or may not work, although in this scenario you better hope that your server keeps up with servicing the requests! If not then you’ll soon DDOS you own server (and database, and router etc) as connection requests start stacking up.

The most fascinating thing about the journey is God practically does everything. Romans 3:28 tells us:
Now, it’s important to look at the relationships between the 2005 data and the 2011 data. There was a less compelling relationship between the predictive data and the crash results for several reasons. There were far fewer crashes (especially fatalities) between then and now. There were (likely) far greater tickets issued over the past three years as states were looking to increase revenues to offset other losses in the down turned economy.
Judging by recent seasons, May 1st (Beltane) appears to be the seasonal cut-off date. Beltane means earth festival bigtime for the Circlemakers. Buddhist Wesak celebrates the Buddha’s birth on the first full moon of the Taurus cycle (this year May 17th). But May also means the Baal fire ritual of the Ancients. Once again we are being reminded (implicitly) how our ancient Brittonic ancestors valued –nay, worshipped– the sacred return of Light in the full blossoming of May Day, Beltane, with the Earth’s rise in fertility, the blossoming of trees and flowers, the Earth Mother’s return to full growth and potency. Beltane was more than just a fire festival at 15ºTaurus, the mid-point of the growth season; it was a celebration of renewal and a belief for all Mankind that the Earth was capable once again of overcoming death, dying, winter, moving through budding of new growth into full-blown summer and supreme joy of life.

Apparently a few days after realizing that he was now supreme chicken, Dinner decided that it was time for Spot's girls to be his girls. They however declined to submit... so he got nasty. Yesterday I noticed a hen that looked really beat up, but she wouldn't let me get close enough to check her out. Then, later in the afternoon, I went in the coop to check for eggs and was amazed at the mess - feathers were everywhere. I opened one laying box and half the eggs were smashed, then I checked another and...uh oh...there was a dead body inside! I called Scott in to perform a detailed investigation. His diagnosis - Dinner had spurred the hen in the back until he had splayed her open - a brutal murder. We found two other hens that were injured in a similar manner, though still alive.
They then decided to splash this word across their back page above a picture of Suarez. So, before the FA had even released their findings and the reasoning behind their decision the Mirror had stated as fact that Suarez is a racist, i.e. somebody who is guilty of displaying hatred towards somebody of a race different to their own.
Life insurance is ideal in creating the cash that can be invested to produce income for a family. When people have few assets that is when they need life insurance the most. The cost is just pennies on the dollar anually.For a 40-year-old the cost is somewhere between 1/2 of 1% to 2 % annually of the sum insured depending upon the plan selected.

Yet the explanation is simple, and it is encouraging. A certain percentage are trying very hard to remain ethical creatures of intelligence. Some of our people are remembering the United States of America and those things for which it stands, despite that their homeland is tread upon by resident enemies, and that some of these have been successful in tearing down it’s beloved structure and in killing thousands of its citizens. While it is difficult to put any stock in a trust of no torture (WHO can be trusted these days?), it should still be the preferred idea that no land’s government should resort to severe tactics of physical or mental anguish of captives. There still need to be leaders in the realm of peace and good will in operation.

Cheryl McGeachan writes: Inside The Glasgow Film Theatre on Thursday evening a diverse mix of individuals crowded together for the sold-out UK premier of Luke Fowler’s new film All Divided Selves. Fowler’s piece, once again, takes Scottish born psychiatrist Ronald David Laing as its centrepiece, and yet this is a film about much more than the man himself. Throughout the carefully threaded together archival footage that wonderfully covers Laing’s journey from a psychiatrist working on publicising his first book, The Divided Self (1960), to the global explosion of his image as a counter-culture figure through The Politics of Experience (1967), this film also manages to become a carefully considered excavation into the heart of psychiatry itself. At times individuals experiencing extreme forms of mental ill-health are painfully stripped bare, revealing the real suffering that is experienced within and beyond the mental institution. However, these glimpses into the psychiatric profession of the past demonstrate the importance of its continued consideration in the present. In part, Fowler’s interest in Laing is due to the humanist approach he adopts and the challenges he poses to an establishment that he felt required internal and external reform. Although the image of Laing has been, arguably deservedly, critiqued his work continues to challenge and inspire those within and beyond the mental health profession, and Fowler’s work is an excellent example of this.

Oh, the separation is always painful. We freak out at the experience of something new and unfamiliar, even if it seems less painful. Well, they weren't as smooth as satin, but they were smoother, all the same. I was still freaking out, because I was afraid to let go and fall into the abyss. Indeed, it felt as if I was free-falling, when for seven months I was without a job and only received two other interviews, before landing the job that I now have. What a cruel game! It wasn't really a game. I just didn't accept the rules. Relax! Take a deep breath! You don't have to suffer, you bring suffering on, yourself!

The effects of this system on Sarawak’s environment and rural society have been transformative. Though Taib recently reiterated his claim that primary forest cover is at 70%, satellite images (pictured) or a flight over Sarawak’s hinterland show this to be patently false. Independent estimates put its primary forest cover at under 10%, in line with the prescient warnings the ITTO gave Taib in 1990 7 8. Yet the depletion of forests did not put an end to land seizures, which were then aimed at conversion into vast oil palm plantations, owned and operated by the very same companies (now international conglomerates) who made their fortunes in the timber boom. With international demand continuing to rise, the government plans to convert a whopping 2 million hectares into oil palm estates by 2020, with much of it on ‘idle’ native land9.
A clear belief system was not part of my upbringing. My father was raised Jewish, my mother Protestant and my best friend was a Mormon. I only went to church when I was paid to play my horn. I once told my father that the reason our family was dysfunctional was because we didn’t go to church together. We can joke about it now but at the time it was the cry of a teen looking for answers.

So why do our politicians sit and twiddle their thumbs? Why do they aid and abet by doing nothing? Can’t they see what’s happening to California? Texas? Arizona? The answer in a nutshell: No!

For several years, I felt cast adrift. There was so much more left to learn in my iai system. Friends offered ideas to help me out of my dilemma and even opportunities to join their systems, but I was never quite satisfied with their solutions until this past December. I got back together with a fellow student of my iai teacher. He had an advanced degree, faced the same problems, and found his own solutions.
The problem is someone saw Kellie backstage. They know she has something in her purse. In the span of a few short days Ronnie and Kellie will be drugged, mugged, tied, cuffed, stuffed, and boxed. Worst of all, Ronnie will have to spend the night at his parents’ house for the first time in more than a decade.

Season four was my favorite of the seasons, although I was surprised by my rankings how much I like season five. Regardless of the individual rankings season four succeeded the best as a whole by telling a continuous story that had several epic arcs within the larger one. From the seventh episode on there was wall to wall action and it all went somewhere interesting. The individual episodes in that run don’t all have the highest ranking, but as a group they mark the best run on the show by far.
The lawsuit names five makers of supplements found to contain polychlorinated biphenyl compounds, drugstores CVS and Rite Aid, which sell those products, and Omega Protein Inc., of Houston, which touts itself as the world’s largest producer of omega-3 fish oil.
Look, I understand that you’re just following orders, nameless army grunt, but do you honestly think that your little assault rifle is contributing to the situation in a positive way? Let me put it this way: I’ve been cowering behind this old Chevy for almost a full two minutes now, and I’ve watched you pump off, I don’t know, like a hundred rounds of ammunition into the giant, angry green monster over there, and do you know what you’ve achieved? Nothing. I ask you, how is the 101st bullet going to be any different?
Well, this did happen last May. Hubby and I together with two other couples headed off for the weekend to the Lake District with the intention of climbing England’s highest mountain. No mean feat for someone who is allergic to any sort of exercise!

It's actually quite sad how ASH cling to this factoid as if it was proof that pubs aren't closing in huge numbers. As everybody keeps trying to tell them, the number of on-licenses is completely unrelated to the number of pubs. A license is required to sell alcohol and there has been a steady rise in the number of licenses granted since the Licensing Act relaxed the licensing laws in 2005.

She can tell the difference between the sound of an airplane, lawn mower, and motorcycle pretty accurately. She is really into letting you know which one just passed. If you don't look at her when she tells you, she marches up, takes your face in her hands, turns it toward her, and tells you again.
After seeing all of these perfect people with all that power, in comes a character that is slowly going blind due to an illness and is a ‘normal’ human. She is the one that finds the stone, using it only so that she can see again. So simplistic I didn’t see it coming. I was expecting the great and powerful Evalle to pick up the stone. The god’s prophecy turns to be wrong because of the unsuspecting human and things take a turn. No one can kill the human or take the stone from her or the stone would kill the assailant. Leaving the human woman protected and able to see. However, if she holds onto that stone after Sunrise on Wednesday the stone will turn on her and take over, destroying her mind and use her body to be it’s own possessor.

Papaws on the other hand were men of wisdom. Having lived many more years on the earth, they knew how to do things and liked showing their grandchildren things. One was skilled at animal husbandry, caring for cattle, horses, cats, and could take wasps out of the house without killing them, letting them crawl on his finger without getting stung. The other was a mechanic, skillfully taking things apart, analyzing each part, and repairing, putting back together and bragging about how well things were made. The one would take us on walks to the pasture field, salt the cattle (by throwing salt on exposed rock “licks” and call the cattle to come partake), fix the fence, show us the creek, take us by the store for a “dope” and a piece of candy, and get us back in time for the ride home. The other would set up croquet in the back yard, show us how to play, keep us from going into the part of the basement where the secret “spirits” were kept, and fix our broken toys.
Because, let’s be honest, you ate a bag of skittles to rid you of that mid afternoon, I hate my job, I shouldn’t have had wine on a school night, lull – and for about thirty minutes you resembled something from 24 hour party people, but quite quickly..you feel rubbish again, and you feel guilty for eating the skittles…the whole family sharing size bag.

I was at a bar that night with my friend R and some of his friends. He was helping me scout the area for cute guys while I was pointing out all the hot girls there to him. It's a little game we play...after we point someone out, we rate them a 'Yes', 'No' or 'Maybe'. If he/she is a 'Maybe', then we spend a few more minutes observing the person until they fall into the 'Yes' or 'No' category. After that, we try talk each other into walking up to the 'Yes' people to say 'hi'. It's a silly game. He's managed to convince me to walk up to one dude so far. I've not been successful with him.

Chronic pain is different than short-term pain. Oh, I’ve broken plenty of bones, and know what it means to *really* hurt for days, and then to ache for weeks. For a couple of decades now I’ve had a knee which can cause an immense amount of pain if I subject it to the wrong kind of use, and that pain will remain intense for a week or so. Pain is no stranger in my life. Never has been.
I believe she really is an angel, I used to call her my angel not too long ago. That was when she was okay, when she was happy, when this image was caught in my mind for the first time. I shut my eyes tight and try to push the thoughts away that have haunted me for months.

Research indicates that a diet high in added sugar reduces the production of a brain chemical known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Without BDNF, our brains can’t form new memories and we can’t learn (or remember) much of anything. Levels of BDNF are particularly low in people with an impaired glucose metabolism—diabetics and pre-diabetics—and as the amount of BDNF decreases, sugar metabolism worsens.

“I commend Attorney General Schneiderman for looking into the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policy,” said Council Member Letitia James. “Unfortunately, in the face of widespread criticism and evidence that stop-and-frisk violates the constitutional rights of an overwhelming number of innocent individuals with minimal results, the administration continues to champion this approach. I hope that AG Schneiderman takes action if his investigations mirror the current evidence and data available.”

President Barack Obama: narrow winner or big loser in November. Presidential election history gives us indications that Mr. Obama either squeaks back into the White House or gets an undignified boot in the back of his designer trousers. In modern presidential elections, only Jerry Ford lost his re-election bid narrowly. Odds are, if Mr. Obama loses, it will probably be on the order of Hoover (1932) or Carter (1980).

The woman is stereotypical South of Broad old money, a southern belle born a century too late. Lupus and liver spots render her hands grotesque, but she grips Devoy’s wrist with surprising strength as she speaks. “He’s always got those little white plugs in his ears, never hears a word I say.” Mrs. Murphy wheezes. “And that’s only the times his father makes him come visit me. He just sits in the corner and glares. It ain’t right.” Devoy nods patiently as she struggles for another breath. “You do exorcisms, don’t you?”
So, the man of God went with the older prophet and ate and drank in his home. But while they ate, God’s word came to the older prophet saying that, because the man of God had disobeyed God in returning to eat and drink, he would be devoured by a lion on his way back. When the young prophet left with his ass, he was met on his way by a lion which slew him according to God’s word. What does this teach us? We should fear and respect God, obey his instructions only, and not that of men, no matter whom they are. In the long run, we would be responsible to God, and so we must confirm every instruction that affects our lives from him ourselves, and be fully persuaded. Despite his own role in the events, the old prophet was not judged, but the young one who received instructions initially from God was.
The key section of the Florida law states: “A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.”
Bake. Everything. I'm not kidding. If it's new, bake it. Unless it's a lettuce, then don't do that. Grill lettuce! Not actually joking here, grilled lettuce is delicious.

This can give you a real feel for the flavours of your food, plus it almost never tastes bad.

Denying rape doesn’t make it go away. Now I know this… I didn’t use to believe it or maybe, it’s just that, I never used to think about it. I mean, I knew there was such a thing as rape but, I never gave much thought to it, not until I saw the body. Specifically, it took Uloma’s death to open my eyes to all I would ever know about rape.

What I want to try and do this afternoon through a few words and some singing we’ll do together later, is remind us all that there is indeed abundant and everlasting life to be had. There is a crown to win. There is peace and contentment and joy and rest and comfort and feasting and delight, and whole storehouses of perfection to be enjoyed in God’s good heaven. But the only way to get there, and I mean the only way to get there, is through violence. Violence to our sin, violence to the flesh, violence to the reigning philosophies and ideologies of our day — what the Bible calls “the world” — violence, as Jesus said, even to heaven. My aim is to call us all back to the battle, where we are to face certain death, sure. But where by God’s grace, from the ground there blossoms red, life that shall endless be.

Perhaps it goes without saying that I didn’t stop being a geek: the following year, when my friend Colleen communicated my romantic interest directly to Michelle, Michelle reportedly laughed out loud, an event from which I am still recovering.

As a result of its unnatural structure, your body processes the amino acids found in aspartame very differently from a steak or a piece of fish. The amino acids in aspartame literally attack your cells, even crossing the blood-brain barrier to attack your brain cells, creating a toxic cellular overstimulation called excitotoxicity. MSG is also an excitotoxin, and works synergistically with aspartame to create even more damage to your brain cells.
Pure Radio also said that despite not being able to fund research, they have “continued to build on our record of successfully developing volunteers”,.

A recent commentary in this journal by Byskov et al. (2005) claims that, despite published results from numerous independent lines of investigation from our laboratory and others, there does not “exist any evidence for neo-folliculogenesis in the adult mammalian ovary.” While we agree with Byskov et al. that our work represents a radical departure from the age-old dogma that mammalian females permanently lose the capacity for oocyte and follicle production during the perinatal period, careful examination of all of the available data leaves no doubt that adult female mammals retain the capacity for oogenesis and folliculogenesis. These findings do not change the fact that exhaustion of the oocyte pool occurs with advancing chronological age–a process responsible for driving the menopause in women–but rather question the basic mechanism underlying age-related ovarian failure. In this regard, studies of aging male mice have demonstrated that testicular atrophy is associated with a dramatic decline in the number, activity and quality of germline stem cells that maintain spermatogenesis during adulthood (Zhang et al., 2006). Therefore, to the contrary of the opinion of Byskov et al. that such a process would be “considered exceptional among stem cells,” it is certainly reasonable to hypothesize that a similar deterioration of female germline stem cell function underlies the decline in oocyte quality and the onset of ovarian failure in aging females. Further, while we accept that a departure from conventional thinking can take years to gain widespread acceptance, we feel this resistance to change should not be construed as the sole means to voice opinions about the validity of our data or the maturity of our principal conclusion.

But I managed to ace (A+) the course and my teacher then whispered to me that I was meant to be a great teacher. Again, I never made much of this prophecy. I wanted to join a non-governmental organization, for all that mattered.
While I was out in the driveway section of the property this weekend, I decided to tackle a weeding / clearing out job I'd been putting off for ages. My darling husband has been working on extending the garage at the end of the driveway for a while now.

Luckily for us, one of the bears decided to head off the path, down to the beach, leaving us an escape route. So, I pushed past my mother and made my escape.

Not that any of them looked particularly interested in eating either one of us - they had salmon on their minds.....

It is only after this homoerotic experience that Miss Lonelyhearts is prepared to give in to the easy "normality" that stands as a false image of true love.

"...They decided to have three beds in their bedroom. Twin beds for sleep, very prim and puritanical, and between them a love bed, an ornate double bed with cupids, nymphs and Pans." It is clear that love will be more a symbol in that household than an everyday reality.

There are 20 instructions in your envelope – take them out one at a time over the next 2 hours – some of the instructions will take 10 minutes to complete, others can go on for the rest of the walk. You don’t have to complete one instruction before you pick another – it’s good to combine them.

Last year I read Plato’s The Republic, and the professor this year has us looking at the “Allegory of the Cave.” In it there are a bunch of prisoners who are chained and all they can see are the shadows in front of them on the wall. They don’t know they are prisoners, and they know nothing about the sun or what is outside of the cave. They are challenged to break free from those mundane surrounds. I thought about what I would do in that situation. Do I break free from what I know and go out and up towards the light? Honestly, I think I would persuade someone to try it out and come back and tell me. LOL I wouldn’t do something like that alone. I honestly don’t know what I would do, I have a history of jumping in head first. My impulses have gotten me in trouble in the past, hence the reason why I would send someone else out exploring. Okay, I’m getting off topic. Back to the story. The prisoners did not want to believe that they were prisoners. They were fine with their shadows.
And here is a photo of probably the most daring thing I have done to date......shaving my head! I think you'll agree that it is not really a good look for me!! But seven of us did this in the end and we raised a lot of money, so it was worth it (just!)!! although if I ever do it again it wont be in the middle of winter, it was December here and snowing, honestly, what on earth were we thinking??

Now yes, I do understand why the government has done it. If Holden goes then a lot of people will be affected, not just the people who actually work at Holden's.
I just didn’t know what to do now

This went to Lillian as a surprise. Anything that gets to the mailbox is a surprise, anymore! haha She happens to love Kitty cards.
However, with Newt Gingrich continually pressing into Mister Fantastic territory, Rick’s campaign suspension, and the impending conclusion to reality’s low-speed chase with Paul (Paul can barely walk, let alone run; reality is just a lazy bastard), we will soon lose all of our comedy fodder, at the worst time possible. Thus, America, I am proud to announce that… I will be your fodder. I will be the foundation of your laughter. I will be your new target for public mocking, your new source of gaffes. I will be your new candidate for the Republican nomination. I may be too young to run for the President, but are age limits not just an over-extension of the government’s power? Yes, they are. Shut up and start agreeing with me. You have to. I’m a Republican presidential candidate.
I don’t fully understand transgendered people. I accept them for who they are, but I don’t always get it in my head. That’s not to say though if I had a son of my own, I’d go through extremes to make sure he turned out the way I envisioned. I’d probably do all I could to make sure he got the love and support he needed. (Because, that’s what parents are supposed to do, right?) Right???
Of course, Frantz, Patrick, Quinn and even national chairman Williams - a regular on cable TV news shows - are somewhat overshadowed by the movement's biggest name... former Alaska governor, 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and current Fox News contributor Sarah Palin.
Since kids are home from school across the nation today, why not bake off some fun election cookies with them and tell them about this important holiday? I'll be baking these with my two sons today so I will share how they come out!
There was only one thing to do, double move, and watch as his glory slips out of his fingers. But oh no, Torrin would not go out with a whimper. He Heaved his great axe spinning through the air as an improvised thrown weapon. Everyone looked at him, and pointed out that the wizard had a realy high armour class, and that the paladin was only +1 with a ranged basic. He practically needed a critical hit to get him.
As much as I protested, he implored that he would save money over renting a place, money over a hotel, and that he was “only little” and fit quite nicely in the back seat. He also said, “I’m a camper at heart; this is fine.”

So the first game rolled around and Robert had wisely put me as an alternate, playing the position of right field (which if you have read before is the flowers and my preferred place of action). Batting once and knocking that sucker on the first swing.. I may have gotten a little cocky and let’s just say it might have created my downfall for the rest of the season.. We’ll see.
Ms. Judd, paws up to you, for talking back to patriarchy rather than being shamed or silenced by it. You recognized a teachable moment and used the power of your celebrity to make the most of it. Vaginally Endowed Americans and fair-minded individuals everywhere salute you for your honesty and your astuteness. You are our VEA Solider of the Week. Peace out.
Money is a claim on the future production of society. If the government prints money and mails it to people, those people feel richer, because they can consume more. The money is a claim on future productive capacity of the society, and when more money is printed, the price of the money declines in terms of real goods declines. The claim is debased.
I have emailed each of the AHS students the April calendar of events. Please remove all the events you will not be participating in, leaving only those activities in which you involved, and email it back to me with your name included as part of the actual MS Word filename.
The day before we left, I had jousted with the Amnesia Haze (this I can still remember clearly) and it put me out for the count. Slept in a puddle of drool I made for myself while in the comatose state that the haze put me in. My good friend was there watching some amusing action film from the 90′s but I couldn’t manage. When I awoke I saw another friend of ours there in the room also watching whatever it was on the tv. We all had a laugh because I looked like such a confused mess at this point with saliva just dropping out the corner of my mouth.
She apologized for calling at such a late hour but wanted to contact me ASAP as she had just received a message from Tokyo offering me an early departure spot to you guessed to KOBE CITY!!!
Ok, so this is somewhat insignificant in the fight against inequality, but I really do think it’s unfair that women get all the interesting underwear. Bras can be balconette, control, under-wired, push up, ¾ cup, peephole, halter neck, strapless. Then there’s briefs, thongs, boy shorts, French knickers, tangas, G-strings, low rise, high cut: the list goes on and on … basques, camisoles, corsets, baby dolls etc. Did I mention fabrics? From silk and lace to fishnet and satin. Don’t even get me started on colours!
As described in their blog post discussing the origins of the idea of ifttt, the whole concept revolves around triggers and actions. While you can create your own, there are hundreds if not thousands of preconfigured “recipes” that can read a specific trigger and initiate an action for you.
It’s been a while since I blogged but I’ve been busy writing another article. This time I’ve chosen to write about The Woodwose and the Green Man, which are two separate entities that are not to be confused with each other. If you’d like to read it you can find it here.

I am going to go and blow that picture up and tape it to the fridge so am reminded of just how big I have gotten, but on the flip side I can see a precious pic of my son and I.
The neighbor came and tilled the big garden. I've been working compost into it with the tiller. The dirt was rock hard and in big clumps so I wasn't having a lot of success, but it rained today so the ground will be softer and I should be able to really work it in a few days. Then I'll plant it with corn, tomatoes and more beans for now. Other things will follow as the season progresses.
The life activity of the inmates at Quatro was characterised by aggressive physical and psychological humiliation that could only be documented by the efforts of all the former prisoners and perhaps honest security guards combined.

The strategy usually works well, and many books see a nice spike in sales for 4-5 days. A few books will climb in rank and sell hundreds of copies within a few days of going free. Some books will stay steady in the rankings for a few weeks. And a lot of books will fall off the charts within a week. Each book, though, has its shot to succeed. For some, it's the book's only chance of ever finding an audience. So watching the sales cycle immediately after the book is put back on the paid list is important.
Teenager-hood is a time that's notorious for bad decisions. Some adults act like that's because the teenager's brain is less developed. I'm not a neuro-anything specialist, but I don't think I "know" more since my teen years. I think I've experienced more. I have more examples of good and bad, and it can help me make better decisions.
The husband. He probably wanted to touch my swimsuit areas again.
In September of this year, in response to a proposed bill to change the law and ban squatting, several hundred ‘activists’ from across the country held a demonstration in Utrecht to protest. With Antifa as with anyone else, threaten to withdraw the subsidization of their lifestyles with the wealth of others, and they squeal. The reliance of these people on living off other people without providing something of value in return is evident, and provides a great insight into how feeble their ability to fund themselves presumably is. I will discuss this important issue in more detail below.

We were sad. Those trees were hand-picked by the landscaper to highlight the edges of our garden. They were expensive, but we had made the decision to part with that money for the beauty it would bring to our yard. We mourned, but got over it and moved on…
Then adding oil to the pan and heating it up. Dunk dandelions in the batter, drop them carefully in the hot oil. Lucas was the hot oil tester, with a little bit of water to see if it’s hot enough. You need to try this few times, of course, and see how it sizzles.

Day 2, pioneer day celebration with Tom and Jeannie. The girls were thrilled to receive a little coin purse to hold their pennies they earned to get some candies at the end of the festivities. They liked sawing wood, panning for gold and playing some old simple games....like throwing a ball at old milk bottles.
Mastering a 35mm SLR meant learning how it works and being familiar with the settings, then experimenting with various films and taking hundreds of photographs in natural and artificial light. It was popular to write down shutter speeds and aperture settings, film speed, and type of lighting in a small notebook for each photograph.
This ghastly rom-com about a relationship between a bereaved self-help author and a lonely florist is told as a series of fatuous homilies about ‘recovery’. This entire list could have been composed of failed, foolish American studio romantic-comedies.

Thank you, Penelope Cruz, for wearing blue. I love blue, and she looks great in this dress that is an absolute classic. The dress has volume without overwhelming her, and her jewelry is understated while still adding enough sparkle to the look.

The most well known of these guidelines are the CONTU Guidelines on Photocopying Under Interlibrary Loan Arrangements, adopted in 1978, and the Agreement on Guidelines for Classroom Copying in Not-for-profit Educational Institutions with Respect to Books and Periodicals (often referred to as the "Classroom Guidelines"), adopted in 1976. More recently, attempts were made to reach similar agreements for educational multimedia, electronic reserve, and distance learning. For the most part, agreement could not be reached as copyright owners believed the proposed guidelines to be overly permissive, and library and educational representatives found the proposals to be too restrictive.
The years and lives of Demented Are Go and especially of band original and vocalist Sparky (Mark Phillips) have been turbulent and unsettling to say the least but throughout the band has fought back to rile up music and their fans with notable releases such as Kicked Out Of Hell of 1988 and Hellbilly Storm in 2005. Times have been rocky for Sparky and testing for a band that has seen many changes over the years but nothing could stop them for long. For all the great releases it can be said that the band has not always lived up to those early days even if they out shone most other pretenders throughout but with the new album they have once more taken their place at the head of the genre with a mighty declaration.
Vanessa is even more annoying. She's set on being a bitch to Callie, even though Callie tries to sort things out betwween them. I also think Vanessa is a hypocrite who thinks she can do things to Callie but Callie is not allowed to retaliate in any way.
Anyway, with emotion running high, the awesomely creative folks at www.extraordinaire.co.za have made a video about it, and I must say two thumbs up.
He also was taken to the third heavens and heard incredible things from which emanated the revelations knowledge that flowed through his epistles such as who we are and what we have in Christ, the mystery of the Body of Christ and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. (Eph4:7-13,1Cor12:4-12 )
These casinos certainly have a considerably higher overhead than online casinos. This really is why a lot of poker sites have opened up on the internet. They can not possibly cost you the same quantity that genuine casinos cost since they undoubtedly aren’t operating a high maintenance and costly operation. This can be why rakebacks are actually possible in the first location. They're the on the net poker room earnings that could be provided back again to excellent customers as an incentive to keep actively playing in their rooms. Take into account it bribe dollars since rakebacks are distinct from one web page to an additional. There is a web site that does not even offer you rakebacks simply since it is currently well-liked among game enthusiasts.
If at first you DO succeed, try not to look so astonished.
In fact, conservative columnist George Will recently published an article titled, “Avaricious Developers and Governments Twist the Meaning of "Blight.”. In it he addressed what he called the, “life-shattering power of eminent domain.” He talked about ESDC.s actions in this case and also in the Atlantic Yards case. He concluded that these are examples of “pre-textual takings” where government uses “trumped-up accusations of blight to concoct a spurious “public use. for a preconceived project.” In fact, the Kaur decision notes that the property in question was not considered blighted until Columbia decided it wanted to own it. As Mr. Will puts it, “liberty is under assault…this time by overbearing American governments.”
I read as many as I could find from all over the world. Egyptian, Greek, Norse – Celtic legends I came to later, in my teens. And Native American legends I have only recently begun to explore as I researched for my book ‘Troll Blood’ which deals with the 10th century Norse settlements in Vinland (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Continent-wide and extraordinarily diverse, Native American cultural stories have often been misrepresented in European retellings, and I went right back to some of the earliest written records of the Mi’kmaq tales of the north-east and learned to distinguish between those which had been straightforwardly transcribed, and others which had been warped to suit European preconceptions. Myths and legends often have a political dimension which should never be ignored: far from being dead and dusty, they may be of immense importance to living people as proud symbols of an oppressed culture.

Last weekend we put up our Christmas tree. This was sooooooo exciting because it was a week earlier than Matt let me do it last year (I think he has turned soft now that Elle's around). Matt put the tree up while I did other decorating and then we decorated the tree together. Elle thought it was so much fun and loved the lights and sparkle. She is really thinkening up (as you can tell from the pictures) which makes her especially cute in her Santa hat. While the tree is bare underneath in the pictures we have since changed that adding two gifts for me, and one for Elle and Matt.

Last Saturday in the teeth of the worst blizzard I've ever seen in North London, I ventured out to meet my daughter in Camden Town. By the time I arrived ice crystals were falling out of the sky. Camden Lock right in the heart of the famous Stables Market was covered in snow and the water was beginning to freeze in the canal.
Not so long ago, a comment was made on the CAMRA web forum that the Good Beer Guide will “increasingly give you the local equivalent of the Kelham Island Tavern.

Welcome, Mr Hodgson. We haven’t been expecting you. If there was a fug of unexpected excitement around a drizzle-draped Wemble y Stadium on Tuesday afternoon before the enthroning of Roy Hodgson as England’s 13th full-time manager, this was perhaps as much to do with the paucity of expectation previously, the anti‑fanfare that had accompanied this most soft‑pedalled of England appointments. In fact, so muted was the reaction in the popular press it was tempting to wonder beforehand if Hodgson might use his first public appearance to get it all over with right now and announce his immediate resignation from the job. Hodgson: “I’ve taken this team as far as I can. I’d like to thank the fans for supporting me. Fan. Whatever.”
This month has flown by, it's hard to believe that a few days from now we will turn the page on the calendar and say hello to April.
It's been two months today. Two months since the last time I saw Cooper and Sage. I miss them dearly, sometimes so bad that it hurts. Like last week when I came across the tug-a-war toy and all those emotions and memories came washing over me. But I didn't cry. For a minute I did think about mailing the toy to them. But I didn't. I just put them it the trash. As much as I miss them, I don't want to see them. Not that I wouldn't love to, but I truly believe it would be just too much to handle. That it might would mean me moving backwards emotionally when I've been doing so great (not to toot my own horn!) at moving forward. Plus, if I wanted to see them that just means that I would have to see HIM and possibly HER too.

So I need a draft. They help me. And I’m resurrecting THE ACCIDENTAL GODMOTHER. When I stopped querying, I knew that what that manuscript needed was a third to first person POV change. I needed to restructure the story and motivate my character so she was doing something and not being tossed around on the tides of Circumstance. Yes, the ending worked well, and even my toughest critic found he had a hard time critiquing because he was enjoying it so much, but the beginning… well, let’s just say it needed help. So I’m starting over from scratch with a POV change, a story restructure, and a lot of enthusiasm. I even have a shiny new title, but it turns out I’m really secretive about my titles… how silly is that?

We tried it two ways. Usually my favorite way to eat pie is warmed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, which in this case meant lots of melty caramel. But there’s almost too much caramel in this pie to be heated up like that. Once it leaves the microwave and gets weighed down by the ice cream, you literally have just seconds before it’s apple stew. Thankfully my quick fingers allowed me to snap these photos before it collapsed.

I have genuinely been looking forward to this. Not in a slightly sick at heart way, knowing I shouldn't watch, but that, inevitably, I definitely would, but proper real-life anticipation. I have been away having a lovely time in Liverpool this weekend, but still, I was looking forward to coming home, toasting a crumpet and catching up on the Sky+.
The old man meanwhile stared blankly into the boot, like Lolly at her empty bowl; you could see him thinking, “Oh?” Then “No.” Then “What brings me here?” He gave a theatrical shrug, slammed the boot with unlikely strength and lurched back to the car. He sat down – need I say ‘slowly’? sinking into what had to be a pile of cushions to give him the requisite height to see out. His right leg was hanging still out of the door. Shut the fucking door, I was seething. Shut … The….

Are you thinking this right now? I know how you feel, because I felt the same way. I thought once I gave my life to Christ all my problems, troubles and worries would “instantly disappear”. I believed life would be “a bed of roses” and I could just cruise down “easy street”. Why did I think this? Because I was still a “baby Christian”. God never promised our life would be easy. Jesus did not have an easy life on this earth, so why do we think we are different?
I took this as no bad thing.
As a result, Volume 2 of Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You deserves a place among your collection, romance-comedy fans, and for many reasons too. It certainly won’t change the way we look at this genre but there’s much to say about a series that puts characters and story first and adds plenty of humor to its sweet romantic theme. If the first volume didn’t convince you this is a great series then this one will certainly do the trick.

(Note* – However, it is important to note that this location was extremely far from Jerusalem, and Yeshua & his Disciples would have been in Jerusalem for the Feast of Sukkot (Tabernacles), as it is one of three Pilgrimage feasts set forth in Leviticus 23, thereby making Mt. Hermon an unlikely reality for the place of Transfiguration)
“In the 1940′s our parents went through World War 2 and the horrors and deprivations it brought. Genocide, displaced populations(if you’re a European reader), military service and the potential of death or disability, food and gas rationing, and the reduction of access to consumer goods. Yet we are told not to accept the tiny actuarial risk of traveling in a small car or allowing our child to walk to school by himself.
I suspect that part of my recent problem with beauty is a remnant of that old way of living. I think it’s a kind of defence mechanism a way of controlling life to some extent and a way of keeping this divine love from me. When I look back at those spiritual experiences I had I do remember that even then I still held a tiny morsal back, did I truly let go absolutely? I suspect that part of me does not want to let go to give myself completely. The problem is of course that by rejecting love and beauty within myself I am actually rejecting that in others and it is stopping me enjoying intimacy with the people I share this beautiful world with. It is also stopping me truly expressing the love and beauty within me.

I didn't want this to read like an obituary, but more like a 'this is what Sunrise closing means to me'. When I saw Sara sitting on the back step of Sunrise the day they closed, I asked how she felt. Her response was simply, 'it feels weird.' Owning a business is, as I've said a million times, a lifestyle. The good news is it's a lifestyle you get to choose. I enjoy it because I still feel the passion for creating, for making people happy, for employing local youth, and for being able to spend my time in a happy and social place. It comes with the price of long hours, hard work, risk, and physical labor. I admire Carl for creating something from nothing, for taking a chance on this little town that couldn't, for putting his skills for creating amazing culinary treats to good use, and for getting up at 3:30 am nearly every day of the week for over a decade to do it. I'd guess he and Sara are feeling an emotional hangover of relief, sadness, guilt, angst over the future, and just plain 'weird'. Endings are never easy, but they do give us a chance to stop for a minute and reflect on how far we've come and what we've learned, before we decide where we're going next.

Also amongst the official feature selections at Raindance is the product of a bold attempt by British filmmaker James Fair and his crew to shoot, edit and screen a feature film in 72 hours during the 2010 Melbourne International Film Festival. The Ballad of Des and Mo relates the tale of a happy Irish couple who embark on a second honeymoon in Australia, but are faced with lost luggage, an unforgiving ATM and an Antipodean adventure. Billed as a film about love, luggage and living on the edge, it shows at Raindance on Sunday October 8, the same day as I’ve Got This Idea for a Film, a documentary following Fair and his crew as they embark on their near-impossible mission.
After I flipped the onesie, I used the top selection handle to move my onesie so that it slightly overlaps the bottom onesie.

Jaoui says she deliberately transgressed a taboo by writing into Agathe Villanova’s part the fact that she has no children and does not want them. “I don’t think there’s been a positive woman character in the cinema who says, ‘No. I don’t want children’. Or else she gets pregnant at the end of the film and she’s happy and keeps it.”

Let me take a second to say a massive Thank-you to all of you who have made this meme a success. I have truly loved reading the blogs that have linked up as well as appreciated the support, comments and shares. I will still be joining in-I just won't need to be so organized and be first. And of course Yay For Home! isn't going anywhere, hosting this meme had just run it's course for me.

Getting noticed among the millions of other people all trying to also get their song on the fucking True Blood soundtrack or whatever. Most of the people making music right now couldn’t tell you the reason they are even doing it. I will go on record and say that 85% of the people who are writing songs shouldn’t be. They should be hiring guys like me, and Richard Buckner, and Simon Joyner, and Tim Bracy, and Jerry from Black Swans…people who know how to write, and then the rest of these bands can stick to what they know – playing guitars, and preening, or whatever. I’m happy to leave the interviewing and the photo shoots and the autographing of records to someone else and just do the one thing I’m slightly good at. I’d be very happy to be the JD Souther of indie rock. Or the Desmond Child. Take your pick.

I had a class at the Red Cross all day last Sunday. It was Client Casework. I didn't love it, but I think that's because it was all about paperwork and that's what I do all day. I found it to be a little too much like work, actually. At one point we were acting out a scenario where one person has had their house destroyed and they found a place but it didn't include a w/d and they wanted the Red Cross to supply it for them.

…until we went to Tiffanys. Due to the expectation of crap weather (which was unfounded – it was cold, but dry) we had kitted up with our waterproofs (trousers and coats and hats) and our hiking shoes – we didn’t fit in with the rest of their clientele – this was hilarious! for me, not sure what the store felt. Nabeela decided to start off by having a look at the engagement rings – is there something she’s not telling me??!!
I knew I had this power to light a fire under the CE’s ass without getting burned 3 months in with this company. I fussed, I threw the most epic of tantrums (I was sharing an office with the passive aggressive sales manager at the time) and quite honestly I was terrified of the response I would get from it, but all I got was “ok. take a room out of order and disperse the furniture how you see fit. we’ll get her moved out by the weekend”.

I wrote the previous parts to this post last week. Today we moved on in our study of Mark and covered Mark 8:1-21. The beginning portion of this chapter is Mark’s report of the feeding of the 4000. There is a lot of discussion regarding this second miracle. Some commentators wonder if it’s just a repeat, an error, that there really wasn’t a second separate feeding. Many feel that there were significant differences which possibly point to not only a second feeding, but a feeding that focused on Gentiles. Those who support this thinking point to the number of loaves and baskets of fragments, seven, because seven and seventy are important numbers to the Gentiles. Also the fact that Jesus didn’t have to worry about the crowd pressing him to be a leader who would overthrow the Romans–the Gentiles didn’t have as big a beef as the Jews in this regard. But the thing that stuck out most clearly to me was just the placement of the miracle: on the heels of his encounter with the Syrophoenician woman.

A genocide that has been cunningly planned all along by the ANC and equally as cunningly executed. A genocide that is justified by apartheid and the victims thereof acceptable losses for redressing of “Past injustices”. A genocide that is explained away as crime. A genocide that the ANC government fully approves of, fully encourages, fully supports and fully endorses by its absolute refusal to do anything about violent crime against whites in South Africa.
I will be at Nishmat for at least one year doing general studies and hope to be able to continue there either in or with (depending on timing, etc) the Yoetzet Halacha program. Having spent the past few years working as a Jewish professional while interacting with so many of you via this blog and the social media world it connected me to, I have found a space which calls to me in a deeper way. Discussing these topics feels natural for me, and like a perfect coalescence of my social worker, health educator, and Jewish communal worker selves. Ultimately, I hope to be able to use social media to make taharat ha’mishpacha (the laws of family purity) less scary and more meaningful and accessible.
We entered the shop with little trouble. There was a small line of about a dozen people inside the place. So we were lucky. There’s a lot on the menu and a lot on display. It’s almost overwhelming. It was so overwhelming for me that I actually ended up ordering something safe. I just wasn’t in the mood for some reason. What a shame. I really should have tried the Bacon Doughnut at least.

This is the type of film that sparks debate. While it can’t be called entertainment (there are plenty of other ways this story could be told) it takes courage of conviction to make a film that depicts violence in it’s ugliest form. The recent re-make of The Last House On The Left (see review elsewhere here) covers similar ground but doesn’t leave you feeling as dirty as this does. Another comparable film is the French movie Irreversible in which Monica Bellucci’s character suffers an attack of such ferocity that scores of audience members got up and walked out.
What ever happened to having a mind of Christ? Whatever happened to striving to be imitators of God? (Eph5:1) What happened to placing our hope fully in Christ and following after Him?

The simple reality is interval training does work and can produce a number of benefits. While that 4 mph run does burn calories and helps tone and trim the body, that burst of energy expended during the one-minute run can increase the overall effectiveness of the same amount of workout time without overextending the body in the process.

Specifically, the power of a firearm is determined by both its chambering (the designation of the cartridge, generally signifying it's diameter and overall length), and the specific loading of that chambering (the amount and type of powder used in the cartridge, and the weight of the bullet used, both of which can variables in a single chambering).

You know the advice, "If you wore it the first time around, don't wear it the second." I doubt many of us were young women in the 1920s, so we can adopt as much as we like of this era.
The notion that all religion is bad is a false assumption based on negative experience. We don’t want to give people a bad taste in their mouth so we deceptively present Christianity as if there are no restrictions attached. “All you have to do is admit that you’re a sinner and accept Jesus into your heart.” Once they have fallen for the bate and switch, they get into the mess that is Christianity and find that there are a lot of disagreements on how they ought to live after they are saved. Presenting the notion that we can kneel at the cross for salvation without taking up our own in sanctification is a classical trick which leaves the Church with a lot of Christians who only have one foot in the door.
When people succeed in profiting on a large scale, they succeed for themselves. When they fail, they fail for many others, sometimes for us all. A large failure is worse than a small one, and this has the sound of an axiom, but how many believe it? Propriety of scale in all human undertakings is paramount, and we ignore it. We are now betting our lives on quantities that far exceed all our powers of comprehension. We believe that we have built a perhaps limitless power of comprehension into computers and other machines, but our minds remain as limited as ever. Our trust that machines can manipulate to humane effect quantities that are unintelligible and unimaginable to humans is incorrigibly strange.

Once the twist of "Shutter Island" is revealed and explained in a presentation by Ben Kingsley (with the help of a white board and rivaling the one in "Tell No One" for sheer length), my mind starts to go back and try to see the movie from a new perspective to see if it makes sense. The trick with the Big Twist Narrative is that it is often revealed at the very end of the film in the hopes that you won't recognize how ridiculous it may actually be. In rare cases, such as "Vertigo" or "The Crying Game", the Big Twist is revealed halfway through the movie, forcing the characters to actually deal with the consequences of knowing more than they were supposed to know. That is interesting to me and elevates this level of storytelling to something beyond trying to mess with my head. Also, the revelation in "The Crying Game" was character-based and the plot in "Vertigo" was not as overly complicated as today's Big Twist Narratives.

And yet. I am acutely aware of the unique magic of this time, this pre-baby period when we still have no idea what we're in for. When all we can do is imagine what our son will look like, be like, become. When his every move is still like a little secret between the two of us. I may never be pregnant again – and, at any rate, will never be pregnant again with this baby – and I want to do everything I can to hold onto it in ways that I will appreciate later.

How to decorate? That's the fun and the trick. Like the coat hanger/stocking sculptures these can go downhill during the painting process. When casting the hand remind the students repeatedly to smooth the plasters to they have a smooth surface to paint on later. Make sure students have a drawn out plan before they start to paint. I've started to require a simple symbol or image be incorporated into the design. It would be great to take one of the patterns from the common threads background and paint the hand that way. Animal prints work well sometimes...if done well. Some students have painted mendi like designs that take time and and a paint pen but look nice.

For the most part, the internet has been a blessing to those of us struggling with infertility, allowing us to connect and share information and support. Unfortunately though, it seems to be another prime source of information and comments best left ignored. The anonymity of the internet allows people to feel entitled to say things to and about us that they would never have the courage, and many times even the inclination, to say to our faces. For example, early on in my blog, I wrote a post which contained some of my feelings about the experience of adopting my daughter. Someone commented that they had featured my blog post on their blog and to click over and check it out. When I did, I discovered that this person had used my words, which I had thought were filled with love, as evidence that adoption was bad. Several of her readers commented that I should never have been given a child in adoption, and that I was not a fit parent. My first response was to get upset and defensive and leave a comment of my own--but I soon realized it wouldn't do any good. After all, these folks had never met me, and really didn't have any valid information with which to judge my suitability for parenthood. Any comment that I wrote would be unlikely to change their minds, and an internet fight was not going to be good for my emotional health. So I decided to leave the situation alone, and it quickly blew over, without any effort on my part.

With the growing interest in all matters food, numerous culinary tours and vacations have sprouted up all over the world. The publishing world has been a bit slower to catch up, and good culinary travel guides are not as common as they could be. Some food travel guides are merely a list of restaurants, but they lack explanatory information on cuisine, and also fail to provide the vocabulary that might be useful for a foreign traveler. If the Tokyo edition is indicative of the quality of the rest of their books, then The Terroir Guides might be a model for other culinary travel guides.

First of all, I wish that Parks had managed to curtail some of leading man Avery Brooks’ penchant for theatrical acting. I realize that “SOLOMON NORTHRUP’S ODYSSEY” was the actor’s first job in screen acting, but traces of hammy acting – a leftover from years of success on the stage – remained in his performance. Come to think of it, I could say the same about a handful of cast members in minor roles, including Janet League as Eliza, the slave mother who ended up losing her children during the journey to Louisiana and eventually, her mind. I had no problems with the movie’s slow pacing, which I felt perfectly reflected its setting of antebellum Louisiana circa 1841-53. But there were times when the pacing threatened to slow down to a halt, especially in scenes that featured montages of Solomon’s duties on the Epps plantation.

Meditation: Do you know the joy of the resurrection? The Risen Jesus revealed the glory of his resurrection to his disciples gradually and over a period of time. Even after the apostles saw the empty tomb and heard the reports of Jesus’ appearance to the women, they were still weak in faith and fearful of being arrested by the Jewish authorities. When Jesus appeared to them he offered proofs of his resurrection by showing them the wounds of his passion, his pierced hands and side. He calmed their fears and brought them peace, the peace which reconciles sinners and makes one a friend of God. Jesus did something which only love and trust can do. He commissioned his weak and timid apostles to carry the gospel to the ends of the earth. This sending out of the disciples is parallel to the sending out of Jesus by his Father. Jesus fulfilled his mission through his perfect love and perfect obedience to the will of his Father. He called his disciples, and he calls us to do the same. Just as he gave his first disciples the gift of the Holy Spirit, so he breathes on each of us the same Holy Spirit who equips us with new life, power, joy, and courage to live each day as followers of the Risen Lord.

It doesn't take a genius. After that, it's much less quaint and adolescent than H.P. "Friendship, love, sex, booze and boredom", with MAGIC - doesn't that sound cool? AND, and, also, a beloved series of fantasy novels and then the magical land turns out to be REAL? Come ON. Seriously. I can't be the only one feeling it. And if it doesn't work for you, just start replacing all the names with Harry, Ron and Hermione. That should be good for at least a few cheap laughs.
Within Desteni there is a saying – Knowledge without application is useless – and that is very true when I look at myself where I gathered extensive knowledge about the functionality of the system and humanity but I did not apply this knowledge in real life – I wasn’t even writing it out where I could actually internalize that knowledge and make it clear for myself where I put all this knowledge in my own words as a statement of actual understanding and where from there I would change and live that knowledge as myself testing it in the real physical world seeing whether it works or not. Instead I accumulated knowledge from different books and articles and eventually I got lost in it not being able to actually be clear on any point or issue because this knowledge wasn’t mine but borrowed.

This illustrates the importance of increasing one’s faith through prayer, allowing divine grace to flow through us to manifest loving fruits of faith and studying Scripture. We can always exhibit more love for others as well as deepen our relationship with Christ. If we consider our relationship with Christ in the way we would an earthly friendship, we find that if we do not keep in touch with our friends, is it any wonder that we stop thinking about them eventually? Out of sight, out of mind. Our earlier love and devotion to them disappear over time.
As per usual, the floor was covered in all kind of football paraphernalia – boots, medical equipment, water bottles, but mostly our team kit, which spewed in all directions out of a black holdall. Ben Rowe surveyed the wreckage for electrical tape. His hands glided in and along it like Han Solo looking for Luke Skywalker beneath the wee and poo of the Death Star's garbage unit. He cannot rest until he's wrapped the tape around his socks to hold his shin pads in place, but he couldn't find any, and he was letting everyone know about it, which, in that cramped changing room, was getting a bit much for me; maybe, subconsciously, that's why I let him have it.
After what seemed like two days of work, in my lexicon of terms anyway, making appointments, shooting, shopping, cooking, a dinner out, and with cleaning remaining, I would have thought I could put more than four hours of sleep together. And, before long, I may well hit the bunk again. To bed just before 20:00 and up by midnight, if I did hit the dirt pretty hard. I remember getting into bed, getting comfortable, thinking about rolling over... I don't know if I ever did roll. *bam* Love sleep like that.

Will this last? I doubt it. The black/white polarisation is growing and the rhetoric is becoming more extreme. Listen to the pub or workplace chatter, read the blogs and comments sections of the newspapers and it becomes obvious. Whites are gatvol at the waste, corruption and stupidity of the black elite. Blacks are demanding, as their right, the wealth of the whites by means of redistribution of assets. No matter that they have not worked for those assets, they claim them as the spoils of war.

There were three murders on Durban beach on December 18 alone. And during the last eighteen days in December, there were 1722 assaults, 111 gunshot wounds, 493 stabbings, and 282 rapes. On Christmas and New Year's, literally millions of broken beer bottles, human waste were deposited along the Durban beach front. There were tens of thousands of drunken hooligans everywhere, stabbing people, mugging, raping and shooting. Afterwards, the street cleaners picked up off 37,000 bags of rubbish from just two streets afterwards along the beach. And there were 51,000 bags of litter collected from the beach - rubbish, human waste and broken glass. In weight, this amounted to 716 tons of rubbish and broken glass.

Even though it is the cool of April, a lone Swallowtail caterpillar just this day is inching his/her way along the stem of one of two volunteer parsley plants as it enjoys dining priveleges its forbears never had. Miraculousy, and with no help from me, two parsley plants have sprouted to the side of my porch. I will protect these plants with daily surveillance and routine fertilization. These twin parsleys will become the Ritz of parsley plants for visiting Swallowtails.
Did the men on board that ship have a better idea? They did all they could and their fate was doomed. There was no way out. Then Paul shouted out, “I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me.”
And we have allowed it. We are the first civilisation in history who have meekly opened our gates and permitted those who actively call for our demise to come amongst us, and in many areas moved without resistance when they drove us from our homes.

e) For ‘dropping’ parachute minister on Penang without ANY vote of any sort. NEPOTISM at it’s worst is why we have LGE as Chief Minister today. In a truly democratic political party (i.e. at 66.6% quorums or a one-man one-vote for all Penangites system (like USA’s presidential elections), no way would LGE be Chief Minister.

So far, I've come up with POV switches, sticking to a linear chronological structure, not switching tenses or between first and third person, prologues and a few others.
Inspired by some of the dark Regretsy themes (ugly-beautiful, debauchery, self-loathing) I decided that for my swag contribution, I’d design a custom Distorted Heart: The Fat Jealous Loser. (You can see the rest of the DH series here.) I’m contemplating three decorative finishes: Glitter, Glazed, and Simulated Menstrual Blood (referencing this post). Hastily constructed, cheap, vaguely ass-like. I hope my fellow undeserving losers appreciate them.

It seems that now, as I finish my MBA and move on to law school, the reality that two years has passed since I left the Netherlands hits hard. I don’t want the lessons I learned there, the feelings I got, and the knowledge and wisdom I found to ever leave me. Knowing where you’re from is a feeling like no other, and I am determined to one day experience my maternal sides’ ancestry as well. For me, as I’m sure it would be for most people, experiencing my family’s ancestral roots, and having it affect me in a way I never realized it would, has stuck with me. It has made me have a sense of self, and knowing my foundation has allowed me to build upon it, and figure out where I want to go in my life. And for that experience, I will be forever grateful.
Had another wedding shower!! I mean seriously, it's my life these days! Not that I don't love them, I do... but some people I tell are astonished when I told them I was having 5 showers. Well, I know someone that had 11! Yes, ELEVEN. Was there even anything left on the registry?!?!

By the time that was done, guess who was the only one who couldn't get home? Reports on the news were that bridges and overpasses were icy and slick; in a one-mile stretch on the interstate, 13 cars had spun/slid and slammed into the guardrails. Luckily, no one was hurt, but it was a mess.

One of the topics in the Portable Typewriter Forum that has always interested me the most is the discussion/debate about what kinds of typewriters people can get who really want to use them. Usability, robustness, ergonomics, aesthetics, all these come into play when selecting a typewriter to use frequently.
With all of this, you may think that Linden, the husband, is the villain of the story. I can surely tell you that he's not. He's a lot more understanding and caring than you may believe within the first few chapters. Actually, I grew quite fond of him once I learned more about him and I think that most readers will, too.
While I was younger my family and I would go out to eat every Saturday. We would have to decide where we were eating hopefully before leaving the house. In some instances we would decide while driving (usually because I had objected to every restaurant someone had suggested).

You're at the grocery store with your infant. You make all the way to the checkout counter without a hitch, when the little one gets upset. You're trying to comfort her while hurrying to unload the cart so you can get out of there as quickly as possible with your food. And that's when it happens. The person on line in front of you says something like: She's probably hungry.

This painting is for Vern Schwarz for The Flying Moleskins. Actually this painting is incorrectly titled, it should read: Henry, My Nemesis! I met Henry while painting plein air a while ago. He walked up to me wearing a blue on blue polka dot choker collar, he had a sleek short hair cut, and the wildest pompadour, complete with a topknot. His owners graciously allowed me to photograph him; Henry was obviously comfortable in front of the camera as every shot of him was perfect, all ready for a painting.

It was huge in its day. Less obviously territorial than the Napoleonic wars, this one seemed a simple matter of standing up to the aggression of Russia, who was trying to wrest control of Jerusalem from the poor little Muslim Turks. When Russia brutally massacred the Turkish fleet at Sinope, the public's sense of chivalry was touched, just as sixty years later it would be moved by the plight of ‘poor little Belgium’. And so the bells rang for war and the ogre of the Russian Bear dominated the newspapers quite as much as ‘Boney’ ever had.

I received this as a review copy – there is obviously a ‘remarketing’ push on this as it appears to have originally been published in 1994, although I had never heard of it. I thought that I had never even heard of Hjortsberg, but after just a coupel of seconds of research, I have learned that he wrote the screenplay for one of my favourite 80s films (Legend) and he wrote Falling Angel, which was eventually adapted to become Angel Heart starring Robert De Niro.

I can’t read poetry straight through like a novel. Instead I skip around from page to page and read wherever the page stays open long enough for me to fix my gaze. I did so today and then I saw it, devoured it, made bare words my flesh and bone. Wendell Berry surprised me with words that quelled my anxiety, squashed my inner turmoil, and rushed new life into my failing heart.
Teaser from the vignette entitled “Forget My Soul”:
Later, he notices odd goings-on in the shantytown where he lives. Shadowy figures converge on a church across the street. Following them, he finds a laboratory, broadcasting equipment, and a cache of unusual sunglasses. After a surprise — and suspiciously hostile — raid by the local police, he returns to the church, and salvages a box of shades. When he actually tries a pair on, his life changes irrevocably as he suddenly perceives conspiracies all around him.
A Bloody Mary!
Think of the implications. At any point in the future, anyone can call out ‘mic check!’ anywhere, with any group of people. And they will all know what to do. And then have a decision on whether or not to join, for that moment, and lend part of themselves to a transvidual subject that speaks, in a sense, through aspects of them. This is a very powerful, new, distributed form of political subjectivity.
Mark explained about the importance of setting an anchor for the rope, which in climberspeak is 'Bombproof.' I don't think we always understood that in my students days particularly as I was dropped once almost fifteen feet onto my back because the anchorman hadn't heard of Bombproof.

I know that plans don’t work for everyone, but I definitely suggest trying them, especially when it comes to weight loss. Since I have fallen off the wagon a bit during this last week, and fully intend to hit the ground running, I wanted to give myself a preparation period. Once you make sure that you have everything you need and you are ready to get started with any diet and exercise plan you choose, there are no excuses. Stick to the plan. If you do not change, nothing else will. Sorry this blog was a bit more serious, but I take this seriously. So I will leave you all with a little bit of motivation to get you on your way.
Well...many, many pounds later (for both of us), and some health issues for my sweet husband, we decided it was time to do something. For me? Strength and cardio workouts, no carbs, no sugar. For him? No more Hardees for breakfast on the way to work, unless it's the low carb breakfast bowl, and that expensive Starbucks habit is kaput. I make him a salad every morning for his lunch, and he works out when he gets home. It's working like a charm so far, we're losing steadily and I've even found some "cheats" that make me happy! For example:

Here are the stairs. Nothing fancy! In fact, there is nothing fancy about anything in the basement. It is just a nice, clean, open space for now and will probably stay for a while because of our lack of time and money. Plus, our kids are loving the open area to run and play.

Yesterday I told the story of how I neglected to share the gospel with our service agent at the car dealership where our van was being repaired. After bringing the van back four times and speaking with this gentleman on each occasion, he thanked me for not getting in his face about their failure to fix the problem and I blew the opportunity to proclaim Christ.

I’m still in a rush today but I took time to check my inbox and, lo and behold, I discover that somebody has actually sent me a photo of themselves wearing my mask! There are only a few problems I have with the photo, given my strict rules about adult-rated material. So, "Mr. J.", whoever you are, I thank you for the effort but ask that you keep your mobile phone snaps to yourself in future.
Sometimes there is not much time at all between seed- time and harvest. Just because we do not immediately see the answer, does not mean that the Jesus has not heard or answered our prayers. Today, we can receive answers just like the people in the Bible. We simply must know the Bible well enough to know His will and His word, and we must ask wholeheartedly in faith,
The tree was perfectly healthy and green, just very tall and we had been having winds for the past few days, so I suppose that just the constant twisting and turning of it was what made it fall, that and the fact that the enemy wanted to use it to try to place a spirit of fear in me and my children. We cannot deny the power of the Lord as we seen how the tree was practically laid down to prevent as much damage as possible. We could keep looking at the situation and say if it had not been for the RV it would have fallen directly into the kitchen area, if it had not been for the porch roof, again it would have destroyed the rest of the house etc. But what we know, is that if it had not been for GOD it could have been a disaster that I personally do not want to think about.

God has already shown and taught me so many things through out the preparation process! Number one, He has shown me that i WILL find Him when i seek Him. when i truly seek Him and His face and not only His hand, He reveals Himself to me. i have had so many questions throughout this process and so many hesitations and worries and obstacles, but God has proven faithful through every single one and has shown me what He can do with my life when i am willing to just submit to Him.

Needless to say, America has changed from those days of 1948. If you saw a twelve-year-old kid with a rifle standing in front of a filling station today, you’d call out the National Guard and probably with good provocation. The kid would be standing in the middle of a pile of bodies.

"You can never tell how things will get reported as a consequence of our interactions," President Obama said. "When we met two years ago, we exchanged beers from our hometowns. One news story said: “David Cameron and Barack Obama cemented their special relationship -- by hitting the bottle.”
Wait a minute! That is the same farm where I had stopped 4 hours ago and they said they hadn't seen them. What is going on? I drove over anyways, met Laura there, and once again the nice lady told us they hadn't seen anything. At which point our hearts sank. We had been so hopeful, so excited to at least have a small lead. But then, this time, the nice lady said, "Feel free to drive down the lane and check around if you'd like."
She's an obsessive reviser. She has a box file of index cards with character notes and situations and when she's starting a novel, she sits with these cards and a blank sheet of paper for a month (always a month) before she starts to write. She writes her first draft in longhand, then types the novel on to a computer, expanding every paragraph ('like knitting a novel'). She then prints it out and revises it all over again in longhand. She records this revised draft on to a tape which she reads aloud, in front of her computer screen, correcting the computerised version and making even more revisions as she goes along. She loves being in the middle of a novel, rather than beginning or end.
It really doesn’t do any good to condemn multitasking entirely, as it is an inescapable part of our lives nowadays. It can help you be more productive and also make boring tasks less boring. An example is listening to an audiobook while you’re driving or sitting in a commuter train. This lets you get more out of what would otherwise be quiet time, and it makes your commute less mundane. Multitasking is ideal when at least one of the tasks you’re doing demands minimal mental effort. That is the type of multitasking that makes life easier for you and can allow you to get more accomplished.

For a year or so now my husband has been talking about getting a camper for our truck so that we can take our daughter camping. Both he and I grew up camping, I real camping in a tent and he light weight camping in a camper or trailer.
I loved exchanging scurrilous anecdotes about colleagues. I learned that one Ottakar's manager regularly had pyjama-party sleepovers in her shop, whilst another had stolen enough money to buy a sports car (he ended up in prison). But my favourite gossip was about authors. I learned that Jilly Cooper was lovely but Jeffrey Archer was deeply unpleasant, whilst Terry Pratchett could be very grumpy, only turning on the charm for his fans.

Well in this blog it’s my turn to play the cyber version of TDCPoR.
Religion is a mother of touchy subjects and it’s one I’ve never really cared to argue against or about because I find arguing about it somewhat pointless in general – grownups usually have their minds made up about it one way or another so either you’re (pun intended) preaching to the converted, or talking to an unholy wall. I’m curious as to what will happen when it (religion, god) will be brought up by a child, my child specificaly, who with his fresh mind will be seeking ways to form his own opinions. I’m sure it will come up sooner or later (we live in a Portugese neighbourhood and if that doesn’t tell you anything you should say a couple of Hail Marys for good measure). I will probably tell him that I was born into a Catholic faith and that I was baptized and that, yes, there was a point in my life when I obsessed over god being really mad at me because I said fuck you. I will tell him these things because he’ll need to know where I’m coming from when I tell him to question religion and even god. I want to influence him but I want him to have a mind of his own. I want to tell him that it’s bad to blindly buy into dogma but, at the same time, I don’t want him to feel like I’m prohibiting him from developing his beliefs. My only lesson would be to question everything because you should always, always be curious and work your mind in all the bendable ways possible. (Yes, even allow it to consider god if god happens to appear to it one day after bouts of atheism — just makes sure it’s never the god that makes you scared, unforgiving and closed-minded.)

In order to infuse a bit of Irish culture into our wedding, after the rehearsal dinner we decided to have a traditional seisiún (session) with a live Irish band and lots of Guinness and Irish Coffee. It was wild and we had all the guests doing ‘Riverdance’ type moves all night! The day of the wedding we rented a red double decker bus to take the wedding party and our families to and from the ceremony, it was a hit! Definitely went along with our vintage Ireland theme. We also included some traditional Irish dishes like Leek & Potato soup and Irish Smoked Salmon on the dinner menu.
I have always wanted to play the guitar. I think my desire to play comes from the fact that I am a huge fan of the Beatles, especially Paul, and I really love the songs played with an acoustic guitar like "Yesterday" and "Blackbird." My ultimate goal is to be able to play "Blackbird."
Take for instance the commercial for tampons that has the woman twirling on the beach in a beautiful, flowing white gown. Her gorgeous blonde hair spins out around her as she twirls with an angelic smile on her face. She's happy, serene and shit wouldn't melt in her mouth. The commercial has us imagining her heading home for a candlelit bath when she's done frolicking on the beach. Then she'll give her hubby a blow job because having a period is THAT much fun.

Although some may be happy with the new iPhone’s substantial internal hardware boosts, the new device’s biggest selling point is actually a software feature called Assistant. As we first revealed, Assistant is Apple’s Siri-inspired, system-wide voice navigation system. It so far appears that iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS users will be left out in the fun, unfortunately, because the feature requires the A5 CPU and additional RAM.

The Out Crowd Blues is the debut EP from Florida’s Vices in which is being released through our friends at Melotov Records. Featuring 5 songs of melodic, passionate and blues influenced hardcore, Vices bring something that I haven’t heard in a while to the table with song structures that are memorable and catchy and as stated before the blues riffs are a cool addition to each song. Think Sabertooth Zombie meets All Teeth, Last Nights and Mountain Man but I still don’t think that gives the sound enough clarification, it’s something you would have to hear for yourself. If you’re into passionate, melodic, fast, angry and riffy hardcore then I would highly recommend this. -Brett

Some new people have moved into our ward and have begun sitting in our seats (both in the chapel and in our Sunday School room). I have personally taken offense to this, so today we got to church 45 minutes before the meeting began. We got our seats. (The other people didn't show up at all - I showed them!) I know that the flow of the ward was once again in balance and harmony because we were sitting in our rightful seats.
Heat oil on high, in a heavy fry pan or wok until the surface shimmers. Add chicken with all the marinade (Be careful! It could splatter!) and stirfry until chicken is fully cooked about 7-8 minutes . Watch carefully as the marinade will begin reducing down, bubbling and becoming slowly sticky, and the chicken will become caramelized. It can easily burn at this point, if you are not carefully watching. Reduce heat and add oyster sauce, tossing chicken until it is all coated with oyster sauce.

I worry (a lot) about what people think about my weight. Do they wonder if I just don't care? Do they feel sorry for me & think, 'aww, such a pretty face, shame she can't lose 20 lbs'? I worry that whatever else I succeed at, my inability to maintain a single digit size overshadows it. A very smart girl I work with asked me one day why I care so much about my weight. I told her that I always feel like the fattest girl in fat town. When I meet for all of my various running clubs, or a fancy, schmancy yoga class, I always feel like the fattest girl there. So my friend asked, "Yes, but are you the worst one there?" Me, "No". Her, "Then why do you care?" Touche.

Hypoglycemic, diuretic and hypocholesterolemic effects of roots of W. somnifera (ashvagandha) were assessed on human subjects. Six mild NIDDM subjects and six mild hypercholesterolemic subjects were treated with the powder of roots of W. somnifera for 30 days. Suitable parameters were studied in the blood and urine samples of the subjects along with dietary pattern before and at the end of treatment period. Decrease in blood glucose was comparable to that of an oral hypoglycemic drug. Significant increase in urine sodium, urine volume, significant decrease in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (low density lipoproteins) and VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) cholesterol were observed indicating that root of W. somnifera is a potential source of hypoglycemic, diuretic and hypocholesterolemic agents. Clinical observations revealed no adverse effects.
But my son, he's the friend who sheds light on unanswered questions, on the mystery. He's the friend that speaks truth.

I offer what has surprised me in my pain: that life is not fair, but unending in its capacity to change us; that compassion is fair and feeling is just: and that we are not responsible for all that befalls us, only for how we receive it and for how we hold each other up along the way.
Place all ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally. Adjust heat to keep at a low simmer for about 20 minutes or until cranberries have all popped and become jam-like.

I took a short drive out to Lisle, IL this past weekend to check out the annual Midwest Distance Gala at Benedictine University. It is at an amazing facility for this type of event. Great track, green surroundings, great seating, etc. The announcer was excellent, on top of his game keeping everyone updated on who was who. After listening to Carol Lewis announce Track and Field all season it was a pleasure.
Although its first 40 seconds are a recording of a voicemail, "Bitter" is one of the album's highlights - a power ballad of sorts that asks "have you ruined any new songs recently?". Elsewhere, "Over You" and "Adam" are highly melodic rockers, and the country-inflected "Someday I Might" closes out the album in wistful fashion. It's nice to see ambition meet execution, and these guys have learned enough from playing those covers to make a sound of their own worth covering.

The aroma has a weird peppery flavor from the yeast mixed with a caramel/nutty malt note, hard to describe but I liked it. Alcohol is nicely integrated but very noticeable. Mouth feel is silky smooth with a little more body than you would expect from a beer this dry. It even has pretty good head retention. Should be even better after another month or so in the cellar.

Sunday was laid back for the most part. Dinner at Titaya, so that we wouldn't become hungry on our subsequent emotional journey, then off to see Morrissey at Bass Concert Hall.

Writing an oral history isn’t easy. Taylor and McNeil didn’t just dump a bunch of quotes onto the page and slap a cover on it. This isn’t an exercise in transcription. Transcription is only the first step. The job of a narrative historian is to write history by metabolizing existing information, paraphrasing and selecting quotations, and telling the story in his or her own words. The job of the oral historian is to shape the exact words of others into a story, by interviewing innumerable sources, then cutting, refining, editing, grouping and sequencing quotations into a tightly curated composite that forms a larger portrait. That’s a different challenge than the traditional narrative author’s job, but no less of a chore.

"Most writers already know to edit out places where they have literally repeated a word or phrase. But the repetition of an effect can be just as problematic. Whether it's two sentences that convey the same information, two paragraphs that establish the same personality trait, or two characters who fill the same role in the plot, repetition can rob your writing of its power" (pgs 175-176).

I'll often find myself stricken with panic that by the time I want to return to work I will be roughly 28 years old. I know, I know, 28 is not old...it's not that which panics me. It's the idea that in reality, who is going to want to employ a 28 year old with a degree nearly a decade out of date and whose only paid practical experience is in retail?! A retail manager probably...Alongside this, whilst I have always known that when I had children I would want to stay at home and look after them, my decision to do so often makes me feel alienated and immediately stigmatised by society and sometimes I can't help but think it will also make finding employment, not impossible, but definately difficult in the future.

It seems that whenever a new conversation about race in America is started, no matter the good intentions, the starting point is always the same. The American historical experience and conception of race is grounded in the opposition of blackness and whiteness, two categories socially constructed over time in ways that have served to define “the other” as “not us” and “us” as “not them” at the same time as preserving power and privilege for one “us” over the “not us.” Thus, it’s no surprise that The Good Men Project’s call for a new conversation about race, and its intersection with what it means to be “good men,” begins with four personal, deeply felt, and honest essays that nevertheless fail to acknowledge that when we talk about race in 2011, it’s no longer enough, if it ever was, to color the dialogue in only black and white.

In a first window PGR, the petition must be filed within 12 months of the patent’s issuing. The presumption of validity for the patent does not apply, but the petitioner has the burden of proving invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence. This window is designed as an extension of the examination process. The expectation is that those who are interested in fields of patents – or in certain patent holders – will assiduously follow the issuance of the patents that interest them, and be ready to bring to the USPTO’s attention any immediate concerns.

They were over by the kitty litter, which was (as I mentioned before) in the girl's section. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. All I have to say is they better get this remodel done soon. It won't be pretty if I run out of coke and can't find it because they've relocated all the fizzy drinks and put them in among the jock straps and mouthguards. My Target addiction might be strong, but its nothing compared to my coke addiction. If I'm unable to find my coke, people might just get hurt...

‘It’s because the rich dont pay taxes that we’re in trouble.’
The class impact of these facts is both apparent and ideologically inconvenient in the “politically conservative” discourse that exalts “the sanctity of private property rights” alongside the “invisible hand” of the mythopoeic “free market” in its pantheon. The fact that those who possess more economic power than others are able to use their political power to diminish the property rights of those less powerful is a fact that increasingly needs to be concealed. The drawback of Kelo came from its wearing away at that façade.

Also this sort of discrimination towards sex work and sex workers is very distressing. There ARE consensual sex workers and adult services patrons not allowed to work in peace, who do need the legislature to ensure their adult human rights to a legal and recognized adult services industry or adult services district (red light district). The above insular ‘statement maker’ is talking without doing any research and without any empathy or understanding of other social groups not of their own. Insular and inward thinking, then authoritarian and fundamentalist to boot. Imposing on sex workers and sex industry patrons is disrespectful and deserves condemnation and re-education, is in fact a sign religion or ’3rd world minded society’ induced mental illness, if not mental illness (hate speech crime?) per se.

I suspect books were written very differently then, but I couldn’t say how, because I’m very reluctant to go back and read them again. I think it might spoil the memories. I did start to read Misty of Chincoteague to my daughter, and it seemed very different to how I remembered. Certainly I didn’t find the Famous Five books half so gripping when my children were into those – but on the other hand, I could see that they were gripped, just as I used to be.
Your heart is arguably the most important organ in your body. It beats approximately 100,000 times a day or 35 million times in a year. During your lifetime, your heart will beat more than 2.5 billion times. Find a tennis ball and give a good, hard squeeze. That is how much force your heart exerts every time it pumps blood out of the heart. Even when you’re lounging on the couch the muscles of your heart work harder than your leg muscles when you’re at a full sprint!

We certainly made the most of our 60 seconds, as Rudyard Kipling said. After a quick coffee and bite to eat, we explored the island – or as much as we could – in glorious sunshine and took endless photos. For anyone who hasn’t been to Scilly, the islands – in the weather we saw them – are literally out of this world. Silver sandy beaches, sea an emerald green mixed with the deepest, richest blue, and these wonderful islands scattered in among the Caribbean-like waters. St Mary’s was joyously peaceful, with virtually no traffic, the only sound our laughter and the birds singing. It really did feel as if we were on holiday on paradise.

What moved me most about Brian's Holy Spirit filled words was his delight and awe of God. Brian had found "paradise," and it was better than anything he had ever known. His excitement reminded me that I dwell in this paradise daily. I rest in green meadows and walk by peaceful streams (Psalm 23). God's presence is so much a part of my life that I think I sometimes forget what I have.

This is a follow-up of the refugee claim by a White South Africa, Brendon Huntley in Canada. He was originally granted refugee status in 2008, but when the South African government heard about it they threw their toys out of their cot. In any case, the judicial review of his granted refugee status was overturned by the Federal Court yesterday. It appears that the pressure that the Black racist ANC government of South Africa put on the Canadian government to revoke the "racist" decision, played a huge role in ensuring his refugee status was rejected. It seems that Canada only takes Tamils from Sri Lanka in as refugees - they have more "believable" stories and are the right shade of brown. Whites from Africa need not apply. Canada was one of the countries that put untold pressure on the Apartheid government to dismantle Apartheid - the result of which is that the country now has the highest rape and murder stats in the world. Shame on you Canada. Oh, and Mr Kenney - how does it feel to be the SA government's b!tch?

This afternoon's Bad Idea of the Day has been announced, with Yahoo News reporting that Spirit Airlines will "charge as much as $45 each way" for carry-on baggage. The charge is in addition to the fees passengers pay for checked bags (between $15 and $100 per bag, depending on the circumstance).
The audience I have in mind are those Christians, pastors, and churches that continue to affirm the basic contours of evangelical faith. They've never read Fosdick or Tillich or Schleiermacher. They don't read the Christian Century. They don't know much about Deutero- or Trito-Isaiah and don't really care to waste any more time with documentary hypotheses. They think Paul wrote Ephesians and John wrote John. They love Jesus and want other people to love Jesus. If you ask these Christians, pastors, or churches if hell is forever and people must be born again, they'll say yes. If you ask them whether you can trust everything in the Bible, they wouldn't dare say no. They have no problem with any of the historic creeds and confessions. The people and institutions I have in mind gladly affirm penal substitution, the bodily resurrection of Christ, and a real historical Fall. The folks I want to address are energetic about evangelism. They want to see churches planted and people come to Christ. They think small groups, accountability partners, and mission trips are excellent. And at least in private conversation they'll tell you that homosexuality is not. These Christians, pastors, and churches are not liberal. They don't feel like one of the bad guys.

So when it came to celebrating with my valentine ... it was a normal Tuesday. We did a normal workout (P90X2 is getting intense, y'all) and I made a normal dinner - this soup. I decided to make our meal somewhat special and throw what little festive energy I had into making some quick bread (Parathas). That's right - we celebrated Valentine's Day with gluten. We watched 30 Rock and I fought with Dinahsaur for space next to Jeremy on the couch. I decided to get in the Love Day mood with strawberries (the most romantic fruit ever, right?) and coconut cream with cinnamon - and a couple glasses of Shiraz. And just when I thought this Tuesday might cross over into Valentine's Day territory (frisky hands aren't just for TSA costumes on Halloween) I became sleepy. And bloated. I knew I shouldn't have had that gluten. And that's where the story of our normal Tuesday that happened to be on Valentine's Day concludes. I crawl in bed and fall fast asleep. End scene.

A true guide for etiquette is difficult to put together. Much of it has to do with the individual person. I have found that those that are the rudest tend to get upset when it is done to them. I tend to use “do unto others as you wish done unto you” as my guide. I do the best I can in the fight. If I win I am not rude to my enemy, if I lose I am not rude. I have found many players that not only are much better at PvP and have better gear, but they also seem to be grown up enough to either just leave, or say “good fight.”
Yep, you could say we were in pretty good shape as we set off from Birmingham and headed for a rather pleasant 40ish miles on and off road to our first stop in Bewdley.
‘Dude, what happened to you? Did you lose a lot of weight?’ I tried to joke.
This will be short. As many of us know, Karl Popper demarcated a scientific theory from a nonscientific one because the former is falsifiable—there are experiments or observations that can be done to disprove it. The “theory” of evolution, for example, could be disproven if we regularly found well-dated fossils out of the proper order (like mammals in the Devonian, for instance), if species didn’t have genetic variation to respond to selection, or if we often found “adaptations” in member of one species that were useful only for another species (e.g., a special nipple on a female mole that was only used for suckling mice).

This bathroom was a real piece of work, let me tell you.
So I'm just going to fake it and create my own little piece of spring... We'll start with a scene in the French countryside. Some rolling hills fading into a backdrop of fluffy fairy floss clouds. A little stone cottage somewhere on the horizon invites us to run through the fields and make our way home. A sunflower or two so you know where you are.
Heat a deep pot over moderate heat. Add vegetable oil or EVOO, about one turn of the pan, and butter (*what the hell is "about one turn of the pan? I have to clue either...I just let the butter completely melt before moving on to the next step).
I mentioned, above, some of the projects that various of us within the gateways, the RDN and Intute were involved in. Some of these had great potential but one or two seemed to be a waste of time. One of the most pointless exercises, IMHO, was something called Secondary Homepages in Mathematics. You can read about that project here. There were some other projects which I felt distracted us from developing in a relevant way, and these were usually related to enhancing the Internet resource catalogues which were unfortunately regarded as being at the core of the gateways, the RDN and Intute.

I reflected on everything as Joe drove me home. Was this his idea of a date? Was this what he did with girls? I made some small talk as we pulled into my driveway. He put the car in park, turned to me, his beautiful blue eyes peering into mine and said the words I had waited to hear since 7th grade.

“That’s ridiculous and you know it. Tutors—and students—are treated pretty well, considering. I don’t think Major Cornwell is planning a reign of terror. Linden was a pain in the . . . Well, the whole campus probably knew what was going on. The major put a stop to it the only way he knew how. That’s all that happened and it isn’t anyone else’s business” His patience was running out and he stepped forward, expecting Katie to move out of his way. When she didn’t, his echoed her posture and with his hands on his hips, he asked, “What would it take to convince you nothing’s going to happen to any of your tutors?”
Business Model Generation gives the example of Maerki Baumann spinning off their transaction banking into Incore Bank (which they then sold as a service to other banks), and focusing solely on customer management and advisory. Amongst the benefits are a very clear change in customers (transaction banks serve other banks, not bank account holders), and a definite change in the culture of the organisation left behind (transaction banks drive for consistency, repeatability and automation whilst the customer facing bank focuses on customer handling and retention).
On Monday evening I was invited to the launch of the Chic 2012 restaurant guide. Chic? I confess. I’d never heard of it so it was with great intrigue that I attended the event. There was one small hitch in the launch. The guide itself hadn’t been printed in time so as I write I am awaiting my copy in the post but in the meantime I decided to find out a little bit more about these charming chefs and not least their cooking capabilities at Monday’s aperitivo.
The black skinny jeans by Levi are also a great item most men should have in their collection. These jeans can be worn in a causal style during the day, and then be styled to create a chic evening look. They retail for $50

Chaos is change and growth, entropic destruction, and the very substance from which everything is made…infinite possibility. The base substance/possibility of everything I think needs no example. Change and growth occur for as long as something exists and either grows, evolves, learns, or develops. A child into an adult, a seeker into a master, stellar dust into a star. Entropy gets a bad rap. It’s not just destruction, it is the necessary wear and tear that allow for growth and change. It is the necessity to balance pattern and structure so that stagnation does not occur. It is the necessity that ensures something new can come along.
That lasted about 5 levels until Laz had a brilliant idea – we could Scroll of Resurrect his second account, boost a Shaman to 80, and transfer her to me. Yay! But apparently, Blizzard did not like this idea, and Laz was unable to transfer her to an account not his own. :/
Keep Ithaca always in your mind. Arriving there is what you’re destined for. But don’t hurry the journey at all. Better if it lasts for years, so you’re old by the time you reach the island, wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way, not expecting Ithaca to make you rich.

A couple of weeks ago a lone man tried to get 3 of 4 into his car, promising a ride home from her bus stop. I now meet the bus every afternoon. It's a shame that a 12 year old can't walk a block without a problem. I'd like to think it's just a kindly neighbour making a friendly offer, but now a days a lone middle aged male in a car alone should know better. It was a beautiful, sunny day and she was close to home, no need to offer. She didn't recognize the man as being from the area.

I wish that I didn’t have to go through all the unnecessary paths trying to fit into society, when knowing what I already want. To at least give it a try, and not having regrets at all, instead of being suppressed and thrown to find out if I could possibly be a doctor, a lawyer, or a businesswoman.

Much of Nourishment subverts what we might expect from a wartime story. Some consists of what we might call expected surprises, the nuts and bolts of fiction, such as the children’s disappointment when they return home from their evacuation (“‘Is that man our father?’ said Albertina”). Elsewhere, the approaches are more subtle: the correspondence drawn between food and sex are clever and unexpected, providing a story of appetites poorly catered for in wartime, and how they shrink back or swell up to change their owners. There is an unsettling but satisfying comic treatment of developments of the day.

"second largest st. patrick's day party goes dark" yep, river street festivities went down, bars were closed and the cops had to try and move thousands of people off what used to be the wharf of this port town up cobblestone ramps to the street and away from the river - all in the dark. generators did power some extra lights eventually, but it was a step back into the past here for a while. the only lights around here were from gas lamps that are now just novelty lighting and not on every street. no wonder this and every other town shut down early...it was DARK outside! i can see why robert louis stevenson used savannah as the setting for the opening chapters of treasure island. the river so close, the spanish moss in the trees and the flickering gas light....a true pirate town. i'm normally not an easily frightened person, but, i swear, if i could have managed to carry a baseball bat AND walk the dog, baby, i would have!
The car heads inside a hotel car park and comes to a halt by the backstage entrance. The sudden revelation from K that this is a private wedding reception – ‘a small one, only 500 people or so’ – only adds to my excitement (and adds the mental note to cross ‘attend Indian wedding’ off my bucket list). Two bouncers open our doors and we’re humbly shepherded to a set of silver curtained dressing rooms, where K and I sit impassively on a white leather sofa and watch the fans rush eagerly in. I feel a little like a member of a cool security team, and get a rush of enjoyment when I realise that, for possibly the first time since arriving in India, I’m actually being stared at with jealousy! And even these stares are only fleeting, as they pass the random foreigner up in favour of their idol, Mr. B. His photo is taken with a steady succession of waiters, wedding guests, young men, old women, and even a couple of stage dancers, all who hug him with violent enthusiasm and try to stay in the little room as long as possible. The huge bouncers towering over the proceedings start to make me feel a tad suffocated, so while we wait for Mr. B’s performance to start, I head outside to have a gander at what an Indian wedding is really all about…

Being either the kindly sort or easily cowed into following the herd, the four travelers strike out into the marsh to find the lost girl. Elise’s trail finally dead ends in a clearing scattered with errant’s bloom, a wild gray-white blossom. While Callimachi scours the ground for a sign of the girl’s passing, a spine-chilling scream echoes through the night. Gunderson and Calllimachi think the voice must be that of poor Elise, but Grift and Solis detect an inhuman quality to its timbre.

My first step was to fire off an email to customer relations. I explained the situation about the computer crashing just one week after the service plan expired and it had died three times before. I told them that they should honor the service plan and take care of this for me because I was a longtime customer. In the last five years alone I’ve bought three computers, two TVs, a digital camera, a video camera, an iPod, a Zune and hundreds of CDs, video games and DVDs. I really didn’t expect to get any results from an email but I started there.

The Spirit of the God who dwells in the hearts of believers, and the third person of the Trinity, is our promised helper (John 14:17), and the “down payment” of the life to come (Ephesians 1:14). The Spirit is not a “force,” but a person. Morrow is correct when he says, “There is no spiritual formation if there is no activity of the Holy Spirit,” (p. 223).

Students should firstly understand the good intentions of the teacher viz. to help them. They should not let ego get in the way. Secondly they should analyze what is being taught. Honesty is the ultimate litmus test for any method – does the defense withstand an honest attack. If something cannot be tested right away, accept what the teacher says and observe events as they unfold over time to see if the teaching bears the test of time.

Praying in the Spirit is usually manifested in a person’s private prayer closet but it may also come up in some of the smaller more cohesive prayer groups where the members all participate in prayer simultaneously as led by the Spirit and where the prayer in tongues (in the spirit) spontaneously erupts into singing in the spirit in praise of the Divine. In such cases the gift also helps build up the community. The fruit of this type of prayer is the wisdom and love needed to appropriately exercise the other gifts within a community.

I got used to my desk against the window looking to the backyard and I got into the routine of writing there whether writing way early in the morning or way late at night. I loved the quiet sounds of the city streets outside and the quiet chirp of crickets and birds. Now in a new location with many more neighbors than I had before (some who love to argue and slam doors lol), it's time to reacquaint myself with a new routine...at least until I move again.

This wasp fossil that has been preserved together with all its features for 45 million years displays exactly the same characteristics as present-day specimens. If—as Darwinists maintain—evolution had taken place, then this insect should exhibit exceedingly primitive features, various half-developed organs in its structure, and also a large number of incompletely formed organs that, again according to evolutionists, supposed evolution should have either eliminated or else developed fully.

A couple of years back I wrote this post about going over to Wales to visit my great aunt who had turned 100 on New Year's Day. She died today, aged 102. On the scale of tragic-things-that-can-happen-in-life a very old lady passing peacefully away does not rank too highly, but I found myself more upset than I imagined I would be when today inevitably came. I'd wanted to marry her when I was little. I understood marriage as being something you did with a lady who always beamed when they saw you and treated you with love and kindness. Throw in 'age-appropriate' and 'not a blood relative' and it's still pretty much a philosophy I subscribe to.

Former Wall Street practitioners say the Street does not lend itself to a lot of introspection. "The world of investment bankers and especially the trading floor region is notoriously hermetically sealed,'" says Kenneth Froewiss, a retired JPMorgan Chase investment banker and former finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "The walls may be filled with screens beaming the latest news, but there is typically an obliviousness as to what is happening across the street."
As I went over in looking at Creating an Army, al Qaeda has a problem in that it operates as it trains when not in combat. Although having a number of low-level operational capabilities that are on-going, al Qaeda can't really expect to see much of a return on suicide bombers: you can't get a veteran corps of suicide bombers to make them more effective. Because it now practices a high form of bureaucracy much of the time, its terror functions must reflect this as is seen in the minutia that is tracked at the highest levels. If this is how you recruit, train, and then put operatives into place for long term missions, you have the problem of those operatives knowing no other way of doing things. Getting skilled field operatives is essential and al Qaeda started out with a small cadre of that which is now down to Zawahiri, the Egyptian Doctor. It must be noted that Zawahiri does not have skills in economics, he never was much of a 'boots on the ground' terrorist and is more a spiritual head than administrative head of aQ. At this point the winning times in Afghanistan that he was not a part of are only a distant memory for the organization as the rest of the original cadre have been killed out. There is no historical memory of those good times left in al Qaeda.

Happy Saturday, everyone! If you read my last post, you know that this week was pretty much a nightmare schedule-wise for me between teaching, tutoring, grad class, AND working at Loft! Add in a final research project and a school-wide function last night and I was pretty much ready to throw in the towel before the week even began! But, I had some pretty unexpected "rainbows" this week to remind me to always look for the good in every situation, smile through the tiredness, and enjoy the present...even if the near future (aka Summer Break) seems SO much more desireable!

Of course, with NBC in the state they are currently in, it’s quite possible they have some big reality show they are developing on the DL ready to spring on their schedule when they announce it in a few weeks. NBC has many holes to fill, and I feel far less confident about what they’re likely to do than any other network. Should be interesting.
Right so on to the challenge then this is the sketch:-
So, that being on its way, I am going to be going into North Idaho College on Tuesday to take my COMPASS test and see what my next step is. I think it’s going to be waiting to hear about my test results and then meeting with an advisor. HOPEFULLY an advisor can help me nail down the courses I need to take in the next 1.5-2 years so I can achieve my AA and move on to a bigger university. Hopefully there will be classes open, and available for me to be in. I really really want to be able to take 14+ credits each semester, actually I’d really like to take 20 or more but we’ll see how many openings there are. If it’s not available for this Spring semester, you can be damn sure I am registering quickstyle for the rest and getting as many credits as possible. I want to get the ball rolling. I know I am doing this for Ronan, for Maya, for the children of the future. The ball has been rolling so fast with Rockstar Ronan and all that Maya is doing, I KNOW the ball will roll just as fast on the things I am doing. I am following this crazy destiny of mine, and I can actually see where I will be when I am finished with school. When I have my degree, I can see myself in hospitals, helping children. I can see myself in front of crowds, raising money for foundations, for research, for what’s important. I can actually see it. Like I am watching a movie. I KNOW it’s going to happen. And knowing that, damn, it’s so exciting. It’s exhilarating. It’s like extra life gets breathed into me.

The anti-everything movie for the nuclear age – quite unlike any other film of its type up to that time. In many ways this is an anti-Noir in the sense that it seems to fly in the face of every conceivable convention – even the opening titles scroll in the wrong direction! It takes Mickey Spillaine’s eponymous Mike Hammer potboiler and then undercuts it – Ralph Meeker plays Hammer as a truly sleazy sociopath with a callous disregard for friends and foes alike. This proved to be enormously influential, the climactic sequence with the opening of the ‘Pandora’s Box’ directly referenced at the climax of Raiders of the Lost Ark, even to the extent of re-using the same sound effects, as well as Tarantino’s Pulp Fictionand David Lynch’s Lost Highway. A horrible story full of awful people, brilliantly and cynically realised. From the novel by Mickey Spillaine.
Fact #5: J. Edgar Hoover had lunch with JFK in March of 1962, where he allegedly handed him the FBI report detailing Judith’s relationship with Giancana.
So take away the “in your face discomfort” figure of suicides, it’s misleading to say the least, and criminally irresponsible to draw any conclusions from it – other than people at Foxconn are no more and no less likely to commit suicide than anyone else in China.
What about activism? What level of political activism is appropriate in the Christian life?
Speaking of predictable, the Portland International Beerfest was no less fun this year, but I was a little disheartened by the insane prices for bottled beer. The average for a four-ounce pour was about 3.5 tickets (SPE of $63). I have always been sanguine about this scheme, because I trust the bottles are pretty steeply priced. But I happened to notice that they were asking FOUR TOKENS for Orval, a beer that can be purchased at any grocery store for about six bucks. It made me distrust every other beer at the fest, and I stuck to beers I could get for no more than three tokens. Weirdly, the very rare Cantillon Iris was pouring for just three tickets.

She told us the fee total, processed our payment, and handed over several pieces of paper for us to take with us, including: the marriage license that needs to be signed to certify the wedding, an instruction page for us regarding the paperwork, an instruction page for our officiant regarding the paperwork, a novelty certificate (what? weird, right?), and a booklet that includes information pertinent to married people.

CD Baby recommends your music to fans of Bob Dylan, Nick Drake and Tom Waits. However, your latest release, thOUGH the Light seem SMALL (am I getting the cases correct here?), reveals other, less-obvious influences. I'll go out on a limb and suggest Syd Barrett, early Milhaud, Peter Perrett, Dr. Strangely Strange, Van Dyke Parks and The Plugz. How wrong am I?

The rule of thumb is: the greater the complexity of the molecules, the lower the g. The lower limit is 1. Argon and helium atoms only translate, that is, they move along straight paths until they encounter another atom. Room air molecules translate and rotate (about 2 of their axes). Hot air starts to vibrate (as two nuclei connected by a spring). Molecules of fuel vapor have a lot of opportunity to vibrate, even at room temperature. The products of combustion vibrate. However, only the translation of the molecules PUSHES the piston. The other modes of molecular motion do nothing for pushing the piston. Thus, as g drops (indicating more vibration of the molecules), h drops. A lean engine (ie, an engine with excess air) has a cooler combustion process and more air relative to fuel than the typical engine with a chemically correct mixture. Thus, its g is higher, and its h is greater.
Growing up, my ignorance regarding the identity of my birthparents seemed okay. It left me room to imagine. I used to imagine that maybe I would just see her on the street one day, we would cross paths, and I would know she was my birthmom. I imagined her as pretty, but faceless. I can’t remember any particular features I had in my mind when I tried to imagine her. I just thought she was probably sweet and pretty. The non-identifying information reported my mother as being interested in dance as a hobby. I felt connected to her because I loved to dance, too. I even imagined that she went to the University of Illinois (because I was born in Champaign, IL), and I imagined that she might have even been an Illinette. Turns out I was right about where she attended college.

Although In Winter’s Shadow is billed as the third in a trilogy, it could be read as a stand-alone. Readers who have read the previous two will recognise events and people from them, and will pick up references to earlier incidents, but the main elements of the back story are filled in as necessary. Arthurian trilogies sometimes seem to fade by Book 3 or to sag under the accumulated weight of legend, but not in this case. I thought In Winter’s Shadow was the strongest of the three novels by quite a margin.

I swear to Cthulu I was so overjoyed at seeing Jurassic Park in this format that I nearly cried at one point. After all, being a boy of the nineties, Jurassic Park was a massive part of my childhood. I was obsessed with dinosaurs as a child, and obsessed with Jeff Goldblum. Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park forever warped my fashion sense. I still dress like Ian Malcolm. When I was thirteen, I owned a pair of leather trousers because I thought that they were the sort of thing that Ian Malcolm would wear. Whenever I go clothes shopping nowadays, a small part of my mind always buys with the motto "WWIMW" (What Would Ian Malcolm Wear?). I even used to scatter my speeches with carefully placed "ums" and "ahs". Thanks a lot Jeff Goldblum. Thanks a lot Jurassic Park, that's why people seem to think I'm a mathematician and a Jeff Goldblum gay. Ian Malcolm is the original man-crush.

Old Mother Nature is a cruel mistress at times. The nights are drawing in, the mornings are getting wetter, I’m dreading the clocks going back and then – as if to poke a wound – it starts to warm up. Compared to the terrible summer we had, it’s almost tropical in London at the moment. High’s of 28; where was this weather in August!
Luckily the excitement must have been too much for him, or maybe we were getting close to town, because he decided not to make another visit.

So what will people be able to do during this weekend? Well, if they are interested in the forbidden, they can visit the printing plant of a newspaper, the control centre for the city’s traffic lights, or enter a bunker under one of the principal railway stations in the capital. For those looking for new experiences, there are tours of cemeteries and artists’ studios, and people seeking the unknown can meet up under a

So, here you are already three. Still making everyone laugh with your silliness, singing lovely songs for us. Who cares if you know the words or not. When you make up your own words, it just makes the songs more fun to listen to. Everyone seems drawn to you. While at the Catholic Schools week pizza party, I don’t think your feet touched the floor the whole time we were there. Several different kids felt the need to carry you around. Good thing you enjoy the attention.
None of the following Breivik related Facebook pages endorse the rule of law and a free and fair trial to be applied in the case of Norway v. Breivik. Nor do any of these pages seemingly bother the Norwegian and English Defense Leagues leadership elite. Why does a page supporting a rule of law free and fair trial for Anders Breivik, bother the English and Norwegian Defense League leadership elite so much?
So you have to try and get everything set up then either set the timer, run round, get into place and adopt the right posture and expression before the camera goes click, or you need something like a cable or remote release that allows you to trigger the shutter from a distance – at least if you want to avoid the other cliché of holding the camera at arms length and just pointing it at you.

In the international paradise envisioned by Marx, the lumpenproletariat will be killed, and there will be no Welfare State. Welfare is a weapon to undermine society, but it will not be tolerated in the Workers' Republic, in which those who will not work, will die. Note that Marxist organisations such as the SWP campaign for Jobs. Those who believe that the 'left' support the workless, are mistaken.

I went to Washington University in St. Louis, where I changed course SIX times (and would have done it a seventh time, but my family and advisors said you couldn't switch majors in your last semester). I went from Physics, to Film, to Set Design, to Art History, to English, to Communication Design.
Yet as they go further and further up river and see the war play out around them, Willard wonders more than once whether or not getting out of this madhouse to set up shop isn’t the only sane response. They come across a USO show in progress, Playboy Playmates strutting on a stage for howling GIs. It dissolves into a stampede, as the men try to get at the women with such ferocity that they cling to the helicopter the playmates escape in. There is no sanity here.

The new tax added by the health care reform law is an add-on to existing taxes on capital gains and other ”unearned income” (dividends, rents, and interest). The new 3.8% tax is often referred to as a Medicare tax because its revenues will be dedicated to the Medicare Trust Fund.

Earlier in the month a Trenton woman had charges levied against her for abusing a kitten.
Shakalakaboomboom’s owner lives next to Punchestown racecourse in County Kildare and commutes to London, where he works in the property business. He had a share with a few friends in Boomshakalaka when trainer Nicky Henderson told him that the horse’s three-parts brother was selling at Doncaster sales in May, 2008. “I said to bid for him if he didn’t make too much and Minty (bloodstock agent David Minton) got him for £20,000,” recalls Breslin, who says that Aintree has been on the agenda since last year. “It’s been very much an upward curve with him and we’ve found out since he won Punchestown last year that he was such a good stayer. We really started thinking about Aintree after he won the same race at Cheltenham in December that Mon Mome had landed the season he won the National. We missed the Cheltenham Festival and kept him fresh for Saturday.” Shakalakaboomboom is the best performer that Breslin has owned and he also has horses with Conor Dore in Britain and a number of jumpers in Ireland with the likes of Arthur Moore, Bill Harney and Tom Cooper. No previous John Smith’s Grand National runners.

Doing it yourself, of course, means you not only write and edit the book (which, on the downside, can result in overseeing the hopefully rare typo; plus there’s no cash advance) but you also do the promotion work, which primarily involves trying to get book reviewers to take a look. It turns out there are hundreds of reviewers out there — mostly bloggers — who will consider indie books, so getting in touch with them takes a fair amount of time.

In their civil action, prosecutors say the sandstone sculpture, known as the Duryodhana, and valued at up to $3m, was looted “during periods of extreme unrest” in Cambodia in the 1960s or 1970s. They claim it was then illegally imported into Europe and then the US.
The only change I made is to add a few yellow crosses in the center of the flower—it seemed to need something there but you can leave it out if you like. Done in a medium purple-blue colored floss, they look very much like a flower we call periwinkle or vinca. Use whatever colors you like. Try brown centers with a yellow flower (like black-eyed Susans).

Then add the fact that Swansea is also home to major players in the social / 'affordable' housing sector, some of which I have dealt with in the past, such as The Coastal Housing Group, which seems to be both a social housing provider and and a property developer; plus the Gwalia group, which housed the gang of English paedophiles jailed last year. All of which I suggest makes the Swansea conurbation something of a magnet for dossers and those looking for somewhere to live at someone else's expense.

Most scientists believe Earth collided with a hypothetical, Mars-sized planet called Theia early in its existence, and the resulting smash-up produced a disc of magma orbiting our planet that later coalesced to form the moon. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. Computer models indicate that, for the collision to remain consistent with the laws of physics, at least 40% of the magma would have had to come from Theia.

In the opinion of someone with an interest in politics, it lacked more detail of the issues she faced during her premiership, but presumably this is to attract larger appeal with populations who are increasingly unable (or unwilling) to understand current affairs or the history of them.

man… he is a pain”… Today it’s the Christian who is the “pain” in our society. Amos was a sheep herder (Amos 1:1)… Note Amos 7:14-15… “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son, but I was a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit, and the Lord took me as I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me, Go prophesy to my people Israel.” Amos was a “layman”… a laborer, a shepherd… a tree trimmer and a fruit picker. As a shepherd, he had a caring and compassionate spirit. As a tree trimmer and a fruit picker, he was meticulous and accurate. He was uneducated as far as this world’s systems were concerned… but a man anointed can do much more than an educated man without the anointing. Amos was humble… he made no attempt to hide his occupation, nor was he ashamed to hide his birth. He was an industrious man… a busy man. Amos did not preach over the heads of the people… He used terms that were familiar to the people, but he also used wisdom and intelligence in how he caught the people’s attention by first speaking of Israel’s enemies. Amos was faithful to his call… He was not an ear-tickler… nor was he an eye-pleaser. He refused to be turned away from the work that God had given him to do. His message was, “Thus saith the Lord”… Amos’ success can be seen in Amos 7:10, where the entire land was affected by his words. Amos was a “layman”… “first class”…

Bottom line: Shades of Milk and Honey, the novel advertised as “Jane Austen with magic”, has something deeper and more Gothic to it that elevates it above its concept–as well as the winningly organic romance between the heroine and her suitor and Kowal’s refreshing blend of Austenian style and modernity. Know any Austen fans who need to be introduced to speculative fiction? This might be just the right book for the job.
I would also like to challenge myself to have one Victorian author to focus on for each month of 2012. I will post something about that author each month and will read, listen, or watch something related to that author as well.

I had a poll in November to help pick the twelve Victorian authors readers of this blog were most interested in focusing on and the following authors were picked:

I believed in better days, where we were all tight-knit like we used to be. Mom would light the candles in the bathroom that proliferated through the house, making each room smell like Vanilla Cinnamon or Cucumber Melon. And we’d open the doors, and the Indian summers would come along and breeze through the hallways, past the photos my mother took from her trips to Arizona and the Midwest, trying to find the reddest of rocks and the border where the thunder strikes the day-scorched ground.

For a few weeks I missed my convenient frozen vegetables. And my convenient frozen pizzas. But within a couple months I'd reconfigured my cooking and storage to take advantage of all the stuff that doesn't need refrigeration. Fresh vegetables would sit on my counter instead of in the crisper drawer, and we'd use them that day or the next. Overripe bananas didn't accumulate in the freezer, waiting for the day I would get around to baking a loaf of banana bread. When they were sitting on the counter, getting blacker by the moment, it was clear that today was banana bread day.

Hailing from Rome, exploring droned out electro pop territories with an interest for a refreshing hyperactive 80s New Wave, Newclear Waves’ soundscapes seem to surround a fruitful visual-graphical imaginary which deals with mass consumption, apocalyptic visions, weird machineries, post-modernism and the order of chaos.

Her prose, hot and tense in the it leaves good welts realm of superb, borders on the poetic. The hell with a bio. Her writing will speak for itself.

I’ve been doing well, but I’ve been struggling with temptations to slack off more frequently than I did during my first forty day stint.

But you can't keep a good story down and, despite the legend of the candiru appearing to be just that - a legend - it continues to pop up on websites and TV shows with reckless abandon for the facts. It would be wrong and unscientific to say that there has never been a candiru attack on a penis - as you've seen, there is some evidence (albeit nearly all hearsay) to suggest that it might have happened. However, these cases are so rare and so unlikely that you probably have as much chance of a candiru attack as being hit by a falling meteorite. Certainly, in his deliciously-named book, Candiru : life and legend of the bloodsucking catfishes, biologist Stephen Spotte - who has spent 40 years studying the animal - concludes that lurid tales of the 'penis fish' are almost certainly urban myth.

Growing up on a Maryland dairy farm, I noticed a stir in the domestic animals. While living on the edge of a wilderness, deep in the northern forests of Maine, next door to the Province of Quebec, Canada – there was a mystical stir in the icy atmosphere – something too subtle, or too delicate to notice, while indoors, sitting by those flickering flames of the hearth.
So I just got back from the most amazing trip around Europe and London. But I shall start from the beginning- at London....

However we, the people, are also to blame for not knowing enough about the Constitution to challenge the unconstitutional spending that has long gone on. We’ve allowed ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security and have allowed someone else (the politicians) to play the ‘expert’ and this is the result. The Constitution was not designed to create a mega government that is all things to all people and supports cradle to grave care. I don’t know about you, but I can barely afford gas for my car, and I surely can’t afford to continue to support the government’s spending of my income. I give to charity on my own.

In a culture that recognized many gods (idols), our God sought to distinguish Himself in a way that: His people would be encouraged, the Egyptians would be convinced, and His Name would be magnified!. The “signs” and “plagues” were not wrathful demonstrations; rather, they were authoritative demonstrations of the power of God (because the Egyptians worshipped the power of gods)…that would testify of the greatness of God…and demand a thoughtful response to Him.
thus you become creative.

Then the other two girls held out their hands and kept gesturing for more. Saying they had to pay for the baby to eat. It was 20 each, or 20 for baby llama, baby Quechan and a third 20 for them. Yikes. I paid 60 soles and we got out of there before they could ask for more. Alright, we were had once. And we learned.

Brides who are in India can easily find the professional Asian bridal hair and makeup artists for their makeover for the d-day but the real problem is when a bride is in some other country. Finding Asian bridal makeup artists in many of the foreign countries would be really a difficult job but in the city like Melbourne this is not a problem. Melbourne is the capital city of Australia and one of the best economically developed and populated city’s of the country. The city is known to have the second largest Asian population in Australia, which includes the largest Indian and Sri Lankan communities in the country. There are several professional artists in Melbourne who offer classy Asian hair and makeup services. Selecting one from them can help you get the best services for wedding Asian hair and makeup Melbourne.
Federal District judge Jed Rakoff followed through with a smackdown of the Securities Exchange Commission on Monday, rejecting a settlement between the agency and Citibank that would have imposed a $285 million penalty on the bank without forcing it to admit wrongdoing for betting against mortgage securities that eventually cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars. Rakoff, whose approval was needed to finalize the deal, was not prepared to let Citi quietly slink away from what Wall Street critics allege to be the central crime of the financial crisis–mortgage securitization fraud–without airing the particulars of the case in a public forum.

The first thing she showed us was a video about the work Mullen has done, which is the advertising agency she works with. In this video I noticed how they implemented a form of product placement for one of their client’s, Livingsocial, in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. When this clip came up, I immediately became ecstatic, although I’m not as into the Kardashians like I once was, I remember seeing this episode so it made me excited. I’ve always recognized product placement in shows, and I remember recognizing it when Kris Kardashian was talking with her husband about her daughter wanting to have the family go on a family vacation to Hawaii, and Kris said, “…she saw this deal on this website called Livingsocial.com…”

There are many people who force their kids to Do Everything Right who end up with angry and rebellious kids, kids who drop out of high school, unhappy-but-successful kids, or some combination of these. There are no guarantees. All you can do is choose how you will respond to the reality of life today. All you can do is choose the kind of parent you want to be today, the kind of life you want your kids to have today, and the kind of relationship you want with them today.

Jesus and the disciples spend the night back in Bethany, and the next morning head to Jerusalem again. They pass the same fig tree as the day before, and Peter exclaims that the tree is withered all the way down to the roots. Jesus tells him that if he has faith in God, “and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen” then he can tell a mountain to move and it will. “Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive your sins.”

Green pants can be a little intimidating to wear because it can be overwhelming to pick a shirt and a pair of shoes that goes well with it. I recommend picking a dark color because I feel that dark color pants are easier to pull off than bright green ones. Also, picking a dark color can transition well into other seasons such as the Fall. For your top, pair it with a white tee and layered jewelry to make it more fun or you can be daring and pair it with a patterned blouse like I did above. The shoes can be simple or you can wear it with a fun printed heel. For example, cheetah print would look great with cuffed green jeans.

After being recently reminded that I have failed to update my blog in a while, I decided that it is due time for an update. I went to America after being in Guatemala for 10 months and that was quite the trip. I originally planned to stay for 5 days for my brothers HS graduation, but after the tropical storm Agatha hit, and the Volcano Pacaya erupted within days of each other, the airport in Guatemala City closed for 5 days. So, I was gifted with an extra 7 days to enjoy our great nation. I got to spend some time in Dallas getting to know Chris' family better and we both traveled to San Diego to visit the guys of Hug it Forward, a non-profit organization dedicated to bettering our world and building bottle schools in Guatemala. We spent a wonderful few days at the beach, and I got to go to a yoga class, which I have been missing dearly.
If there is any “cure” for children or youth with gender identity issues, it can be found within the keywords acceptance, androgyny, compromise and communication.. It is important for parents to recognize that children need to be accepted for who they are, not for what others perceive they should be. This is also true for children with gender identity issues. There is a variety of gender specialized material which indicates that having a transgender identity or crossdressing needs is not mentally disordered, mentally diseased or abnormal. Once that fact is recognized, it is easy to understand that the majority of difficulties transgender persons face do not originate internally or from their own question-asking process. Rather, the origin of their difficulties is external, resulting from the abuse, harassment and violence transgender persons face from people who cannot accept differences in others.. Parents can play a major role in teaching children how to communicate effectively and counteract abuse from others who cannot accept differences.
My next reply was from MaheDrysdale the 5 time world champion and Olympic bronze medalist in 2008 in my old event the single sculls says that superstitious routines can only be a hinderance as if they do not happen the way you wanted them to it only serves to hinder your performance mentally if you do not do them the same way every time.
But there was still that nagging problem. Ever since spring of my senior year, I’d felt blocked every time I tried to write. I knew what I wanted to say, but I couldn’t do it. I could see that the result wasn’t ideal, and I knew I was capable of doing better. Yet I couldn’t. I got the same sorts of comments on my papers: great ideas, but the writing needs work. I was normally a good writer, which helped me to excel in English.

That’s why Bessant and Drury’s win for their (*deep breath*) egg free, soya free, nut free, gluten free, dairy free, vegan ice cream caught my eye. (I think they’re probably wheat free, too, but need to check on that.) They’ve created a product that is not just aimed at the food allergy market but that can still declare itself to be allergy safe for many. I’d like to think this is the future for free from foods: not a specialist niche but an attempt to create properly luxury products that exclude the main allergens, but where taste is all.

The support actors, in particular Shreyas Talpade and Arjun Rampal are well cast in their roles. Being a Farah Khan film, of course the songs are exceptionally well choreographed and filmed. One of the things we appreciate Farah for is her determination that her leading men should be objectified as much as, if not a little more than, the glamorous heroines. She outdoes herself with Dard-e-Disco which has hilariously bad lyrics (apparently she kept telling Javed Akhtar to make his lyrics worse) and is full of gratuitous shots of SRK in, emerging from, and being doused with, water.

Children are selfish, but become civilized as they grow older and take responsibility for the world around them. This is becoming adult. However, the new culture prevents them from growing up and keeps them immature which is causing so much uncivilised behaviour. Bar owners and the drinks companies play on the weaker part of people’s nature rather like a sales scam would play on, say, someone’s greed. It is preying on the young’s need for fun and adventure with unhealthy adventures.

I have one friend that has been a friend for many years. Lately, we have been drifting apart. All friendships go through waves. I know this, but I am thinking this is more than a wave. This is a tsunami. We seem to have nothing in common anymore. She has a new man (well, okay, not so new - they've been together for 2 years), but he does not like me at all. I represent a time in her life that he was not a part of and did not approve of. So, our friendship is dying.

Just as your questions are based on the predication that the police could not have possibly taken so long to respond to our call for assistance (and the cause for delay must have been within Yarra Trams), our Fleet Operator also believed that police would be available to meet with the tram in a timely manner. Regrettably in this instance, there were no police officers available to attend to the tram until 7:20pm, which contributed to the negative experience of those customers onboard the first Route 86 tram.

To provide more meaningful information to women when they are choosing their mode of birth, there is a pressing need to document medium- to long-term outcomes in women and their babies after a planned CS or a planned vaginal birth. First, it should be possible to gather data using standardised questions (traditional paper-based questionnaires and face-to-face interviews) about maternal septic morbidities and emotional wellbeing up to 1 year after a planned CS in a population of women who have consented for follow-up. Internet-based questionnaires could also be devised, to achieve the high response rates required for a full interpretation of the data. Similarly, it would be important to collect high-quality data on infant morbidities after a planned CS compared with a planned vaginal birth. A long term morbidity evaluation (between 5 and 10 years after the CS) would use similar methodology but assess symptoms related to urinary and gastrointesinal function.

In Bible days, Bible heroes were focused on operating as gods on earth. Take for instance Moses and Aaron. They lived as gods, particularly Moses. In Exodus 7:1-2, God told Moses that He had made him a god to Pharaoh. Who was Pharaoh? At this time, Pharaoh was virtually the ruler of the world. Can you imagine that such a king who was feared above other kings was to see Moses as a god? Even today it is still so. God’s saints have been empowered to be gods to the Pharaohs of this world. However, operating in the light of this revelation depends entirely on them. From the experience of Egypt, there was chaos, fear, trembling and lots of trouble whenever Moses came into the land to see Pharaoh. Can you imagine two men affecting and determining what happens with the administration, economy, security, agriculture, health, movement, food and drink, the lives of families and cattle of the nation of Egypt? And once Moses made a pronouncement to Pharaoh, irrespective of whether he believed it or not, his word was law and bound to happen. You too can control your nation as a god of this world by ensuring you carry God’s presence.

The shoes go along with this - they're very pretty, and higher than I would wear to work, but I have chosen not to wear spikes. They're a single colour, with the heels thicker and lower than the name-brand tango shoes, and incidentally they're about half the price and they go with more of my outfits. Now it's mainly that I've tried tango spikes and I just don't really get on with them, but if these send a message that I'd prefer to underpromise and overdeliver rather than the contrary, that's fine with me.

My man had a birthday recently, and he chose these chocolate malt cupcakes to help celebrate. The cupcakes had a moist and fluffy consistancy and the perfect amout of chocolate flavor. The frosting was delicious, but only after it had time for the flavors to marry overnight. I thought it was far too sweet right after making it, so i would frost these the night before so the sweetness has time to calm down a bit. I didn't get an overwhelming malt flavor in the cupcake or the frosting, so next time I may try adding more malt. I'll probably also crush up some malt balls and sprinkle them onto the frosting for an extra whammy.

The ice sliding down a brown bottle, the first bitter taste on the tongue and the exhilaration of that first swallow…. Ahhh. Nothing can truly describe it. Beer as blessing, oh yes.
The strike took place this morning five miles from the town of Khashef in Yemen’s northern Jawf province, 87 miles east of the capital, Sanaa.
Friends and podcasters John S. Drew and Paul K. Bisson have released the latest episode of Cyborgs: A Bionic Podcast, which devotes itself to revisiting the cult-classic TV series The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman. They always bring in a guest host to share in the fun, and for this installment I was called up for my second stint in the third chair.
I waited to the left of the large rock where the river twists like a snake.The coolness of the night air was refreshing after the stiffling heat of the day. I waited for three hours after the sun had set and then reluctantly made my way north……..alone.
Doesn’t that make you feel special?

I Am 2 is now engaged in a project to provide temporary shelter, food, water and adult care to 37 orphans in Migori, Kenya. We are trying to raise up an army of compassionate people who will each contribute whatever they can – even $5-10 each, to help us provide care for these children until our partner in the project, BrightPoint for Children, can secure sponsorships for these 37 kids.

So a couple of weekends ago when a bunch of mommy friends and I were at Mz. Ruby Jane's 4th Birthday/Pinata Bashing Fiesta, I let it be known that for my 39th birthday (which is looming EVER larger), all I really wanted to do was to get all the girls dressed up (like we used to do) and go out to eat at a nice/swanky scene-worthy restaurant (also, like we used to do) and go enjoy each others' buzzed company (yes, like we used to).
"Jesus, I thank you for little daily crosses, for opposition to my endeavors, for the hardships of communal life, for the misinterpretation of my intentions, for humiliations at the hands of others, for the harsh way in which we are treated, for false suspicions, for poor health and loss of strength, for self-denial, for dying to myself, for lack of recognition in everything, for the upsetting of all my plans....

“Here in America, we believe that all of us are equal and that each of us deserves the chance to pursue our own version of happiness. It’s what led us to become a nation. It’s at the heart of who we are as a people. And our history is defined by the struggle to fulfill this ideal – to build a more perfect union, to ensure that all of us, regardless of our race or religion, our color or our creed, are afforded the same rights as Americans, and the fair and equal treatment under the law.
But woe to you if -- or more likely, when -- the rules change. White Americans may soon find themselves unable or unwilling to stand up to challenge the new political methods that will be the inevitable result of the ethnic metamorphosis now taking place in America. Unable to cope with the new rules of the game -- violence, mob riots, intimidation through accusations of racism, demands for proportionality based on racial numbers, and all the other social and political weapons used by the have-nots to bludgeon treasure and power from the haves -- Americans, like others before them, will no doubt cave in. They will compromise away their independence and ultimately their way of life.
And on, and on, and on it will go senselessly for several pages. When you actually finish reading those pages, if you still weren’t brain-dead, it will occur to you that the flippin’ name that was asked, hasn’t been mentioned at all. No kidding!
After looking over healthy suggestions for food I kept seeing lentils, so I thought I'd give them a try this week.

The most effective offensive maneuver is a preemptive one. The United States government might get antsy and dispense with the prospect of gaining any knowledge, wisdom, or new technology the object may have to offer in lieu of preventing an Independence Day-like assault on our precious American soil.
I thought I would check out my stash of vintage Golden Books to see how many more books I need and that's when I realized that I had a few duplicates. I do have a great assortment but I have to laugh at all the duplicates I have. I've collected:

People often attend plays, concerts, and other events. At these events the spectators only see what is on the outside. What is onstage. Some people are in amazement at what they see, others couldn’t be impressed. The fact is we do not know what is going on backstage, behind the scenes. Just like a contest to win a one-time free backstage pass to see a favorite performer or playwrite, HaShem did the same thing with The Jewish People. He went around to all the nations and asked them if they would like a “backstage pass” to the wisdom of creation, i.e., the Torah. The nations didn’t win the contest because of their decline in the offer.

A small cluster of Tear Peas lightly-dressed with Mascarpone and topped with a nest of thin sorrel ribbons, was a grassier mouthful than expected – the tiny green jewels tasting intensely of pea shoots rather than sweet baby peas.
So, I decided to try to develop some lessons on germs, with the goal of communicating the importance of NOT SPREADING THEM clearly to the children, in a way that they could really understand.

The Constitutional Court also briefly discussed possibility of applying competition law, Art. 101 and Art. 102 TFEU, pointing to recent decision in Football Association Premier League C-403/08 and Karen Murphy C-429/08.

So says the Swede (Burt Lancaster) as he lies in bed bereft of all hope, and calmly awaits his end. I love that scene near the beginning of the 1946 version of The Killers. It is one of the great moments of film noir and says so much about the genre – if you can even call it a genre. A good deal of its bleak power comes from the fact that it seems to run contrary to all normal human instincts. If someone were to burst into your room and breathlessly inform you that a couple of mean-looking hitmen had just rolled into town with the express aim of rubbing you out, most people would take the opportunity to make tracks fast. But Lancaster just remains prone in the shadows and delivers that line in the detached tone of a man already dead; when fate pays that last call there’s no ducking out.

When you eat food that is not organic, what you are eating is loaded with poisons and chemicals. Companies that produce food for the masses have one thing in mind, quantity not quality. They will do what ever they have to do to get as much food as they can from point A (the ground that is depleted of ) to point B (your mouth). They are trying to prolong the shelf life of the natural food so that you have a chance to purchase it.

I apologize for the all-caps paragraph, but it’s the only way I know how to get across the way the guy was yelling at me at the top of his voice in surprise. As I mentioned before, Jonathan is a celebrity in Thialf, and even though my new friend knew that speedskating was not a major sport in America (given his initial surprise that I was even there) he somehow thought, I guess, that the top American skaters might still be given some sort of sports-star perks anyway. (Traveling-companion tickets, maybe? I’d go for that!)

Yesterday, I blogged about the insanity and inanity which has characterised the compilation of the Edinburgh Fringe Programme this year. In particular, the barking mad decision by the Fringe that the title STUART GOLDSMITH: PRICK was unacceptable and that it should be replaced by the title STUART GOLDSMITH: PR!CK which was acceptable.

What we hinge about is sailing, racing, promoting sailing, teaching sailing, having a great youth sailing/racing program, cruising the general area and did I mentioned sailing already?! Our Thursday night racing series goes from daylight savings start to finish (or thereabouts). Every Thursday night we have 5 starts for different classes from centerboard (where I enroll my Laser every week) with Lasers, Windmills, Flying Scots, Fireball, Snipe, etc. to Spin “A” with J120, J109, J35, etc. Yeah, we also have non-spin A & B, racer-cruiser, J24-Melges 24 starts, etc. Every night 30 to 50 racing sailboats on the water. An all volunteer race committee takes turns serving or racing, four co-captains share the responsibility, all racers take turns serving as race committee. On Thursday nights, we are open to the community, dinner and drink tickets. Around 300 or more folks visit our facilities to participate in the races. The truest lung for the city of Tampa and surrounding areas.

Here is Darcus Howe being interviewed by the BBC. With the benefit of hindsight he foresaw these riots coming and it is all because the police have been stopping and searching young black men like his 'angel' grandson for no reason at all.
I think the motivation to get good grades is what drives me to, you know, complete stuff. Writing on my own for fun is very different.
Later that night, as we cleared up from dinner, Jasmine asked me why someone had put away all the cookies but left about six still on the tray. I thought that was weird too, and then it dawned on me—Buzz had struck again! That naughty, rascally dog had eaten a few dozen cookies right off the tray. No more cookies for Christmas Day! Unfortunately, that was the proverbial last straw for me. I began to weep. All the pressure and struggle of an entire week culminated in that moment. We had to have the special Christmas cookies! Or Christmas would be ruined!
Which is why I try to keep the guilt away while happily watching, discussing, laughing over, learning from, and enjoying my favorite TV shows.

The Bible is the Word of God; His revelation of Himself to man so that man can understand himself and his role in relation to his Creator. There are many men behind the pulpits of todays churches who quite frankly are false teachers, whether by intention, or ignorance, is not for me to judge, but the results are the same. Whenever and wherever people teach that God is love, and fail to teach that He is holy, just, and hates sin they are NOT teaching the truth as the Bible reveals it.

Oklahoma A&M has its very own Prince Hal in Sean Sutton, the sickly and aged-before-his-time heir apparent finally took the throne from Sutton I during the Great Abdication. While Sean has shown some flashes of the greatness of Eddie, his Big12 record speaks for itself. While a win at Baylor and a strong showing in the Big12 Tourney may prove this humble writer wrong, we believe that the true coaching genes in the family were passed not to Sean, but to Oral Roberts coaching phenom Scott Sutton.

A democracy as deduced by the populace who, all for active activism aiming to infiltrate into a course called governance, are presuming that a majority decision will be fair. I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who observed that Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner. And mistakenly so, the entire concept of administration is falling apart courtesy footloose activist thriving largely on polity, a nation’s mass hodgepodging the very ideas of jingoism and rationality and the oblivious government shambling through its log of scams and unattended primacy.
Five of them, running towards Shatterbury station, which lay a couple of hundred yards up track beyond where the Spur met the mainline. They saw no trains as they ran, with Solemn in front, Features, Cleft and Bouncer bringing up the rear. Ben was sandwiched between, in case he had second thoughts on the matter. Ben had no second thoughts. Infiltrating this gang was the force's priority in Shatterbury, and he was going to be the one to break it open.

Surveys* show that 27.6% of Dalits are still prevented from entering police stations and 25.7% from entering ration shops. Thirty-three per cent of public health workers refuse to visit Dalit homes, and 23.5% of Dalits still do not get letters delivered in their homes. Segregated seating arrangements for Dalits are found in 30.8% of self-help groups and cooperatives, and 29.6% of panchayat offices. In 14.4% of villages, Dalits are not permitted even to enter the panchayat building. In 12% of villages, they are denied access to polling booths or forced to form a separate line.
As for why I'm not on Facebook... well, to a certain extent, this. But there's more to it than that. You may have heard the quip 'Twitter makes you love people you don't know, Facebook makes you hate people you do know'. I feel there's something in that. Not only does going on Facebook open me up to the risk of being 'friended' by people who picked on me in high school (of whom there are many, though I brought it on myself), but it's also a much more backward-looking system.

Speaking professionally - where to begin? Part I
So I know y’all want a travel story and let me start off by saying I WOULD LOVE TO NOT have one for you all....cuz I’m tired...and my body/brain needs a break from incidents (praying that my flight to Chicago is smooth & UNEVENTFUL). Well I have a doozy of a story for ya and I hope you all laugh cuz I did laugh but afterwards I SHOOK MY OWN head at myself. I’m pretty sure James is rethinking my decision to travel alone...yep I’m pretty sure he is LOL. My flight to Texas started out in Virginia at 7 am flying to Chicago first...I had the WORST migraine on the plane so midway I woke up to take a few Advil...3 to be exact and leaned back to go back to sleep. Woke up about 20 mins later feeling slightly “odd” (yes odder than usual lol) and woozy and knew something wasn’t right & figured I was either getting a bad migraine or a sinus infection. So I leaned down to take another Advil just in case...when to my HORROR I realized I had taken 3 Maximum Strength Benadryl instead...UH OH!!! Benadryl DRUGS ME...like woozy, stumbling, drool on my darn self kinda drug me...ok, not pretty at all. AND THEY HIT ME LIKE A BRICK OMG...I literally was like a drunk...slurring my words and stumbling. I stumbled up the gangplank to exit the plane in Chicago and I could barely walk people...I texted hubby to say “ummmm I think I mighta made an oopsie...a big one”...well he’s not really surprised much by me after 18 years so his response (in typical James form we call “James-isms”) “well ok, as long as you are somewhere safe you’ll be ok”. UMMM DID YOU HEAR ME...I AM DRUGGED and its NOT PRETTY...HELLLOOOOOOOOO!!! But I guess cuz’ I was in an “airport” that suddenly I was contained and safe to him LMBO...yep....not! Cuz Suzanne thought getting on the people movers to her next gate would be helpful....less walking right? RIGHT??? Umm yeah I put my small wheelie tote on the people mover & for whatever reason it made me dizzy and I lost my balance...I DID THE DARN SPLITS ON THE PEOPLE MOVER...it was NOT a good site (it was not sexy, hot or cool in ANY way ok). And I split my jeans open....where you ask? WELLLL right in my darn butt area....did I have clothes in my tote...of course not...that would never be my luck huh? And yeah I had red undies (clean ones though that did over my rear) on and my jacket DID not cover it...so I’m trying to get upright and the guy behind me is trying to help me and I KNOW he’s trying to NOT laugh and I’m like “no, no I GOT THIS” as I stumble off and try to arrange my jacket around my waist in a manner that didn’t look like I was trying to cover up something LOL. I get to the gate and sit down & the man next to me is chatty-cathy...wrong time bud ok--you have nooo idea who or what you are talking to right now! I think I slurred something like “immmmm soooo slorrry but I am berry heavibly medicated and am having sub bigggg isssueeesss”...he looked at me like he felt badly for me and hey at that point I felt badly for me toooo LOL and figured it was best to sit there and NOT move or talk until it was time to get on plane--so I pretended to be a statue & VERY interested in my phone although I was so medicated I'm sure drool was coming out as my head bobbed up & done...oy vey!! So I go and get on plane....oh yeah that was fun...Suzanne tripping on the plane and literally running my body down the wall of the gangplank so I didn’t fall...I looked REALLLY special at that point ;) I was lucky to get a window seat in the second row...two guys sit next to me and I’m trying to NOT make eye contact cuz I don’t wanna look like a drugged weirdo LOL. I cover up with my blankie and go to sleep...wake up halfway thru flight and feel “slightly” better, enough to form somewhat sane sentences. So I asked stewardess for 3 cokes...yep 3...trust me I really needed about 20 at that point & I musta looked like I did cuz she brought them quickly. The guys next to me start laughing & I’m like you have nooooo idea buddies so just shut up cuz I’m not in the mood. Ends up the guy next to me is a fighter pilot who had traveled home from a tour in Afghanistan and had been traveling 3 days (yeah made my travel journey not so sad huh). So we were chatting about the military and stuff and the guy on the end joined in. So we are all chatting having a GRAND time & the guy on the end asks me what I’m doing in San Antonio and blah blah blah....wants to know if I’m there for the Rodeo (I wish cuz I have always wanted to go). Turns out the guy on the end is Joe Nichols...yep the country singer...yep I didn’t recognize him...AT ALL and I yell “you liar...you are not”...yeah real good zinger Suzanne, geesh! And he pulls out his drivers license & sings a line of his song “Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off”...umm yeah appropriate song for a girl who has her undies hanging out of her darn pants LMBO!! But he was really nice and he signed my Country Weekly magazine which I JUST happened to have in my bag (no pants but darn it I have some magazines) and invited me to rodeo where he was singing today. DARN IT...if I didn’t have to be home I soooo woulda stayed an extra day to hang out...I mean of all the darn luck...split pants druggie sits next to Joe Nichols and can’t go to the rodeo...UGH...story of my life LOL! Needless to say we get to San Antonio just fine (via Houston) and then I rent a car to drive 3 hours to Waco...in the pouring rain on a Friday afternoon...yep thru Austin traffic. Took me 5 beautiful, oh so fabulous hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic...had to pee...was a tad hungry...and bum tired but darn it I got to Waco. Great class....great ladies (waving hi) who now all KNOW that I really am a total nut LOL but hope they had fun and I promise I will be back in Texas this year...albeit not drugged ;) And if you are near Waco stop at Emmalie’s fabulous store Crop Paper Scissors...you won’t be disappointed!!

Mummy hope you understand in time to come, that you always a precious baby to mummy.
What I love the most about these photographs is that they show the range and versatility of the artist. Nolan does these ultra-fine cinderblock paintings that are so realistic, your eye is literally tricked to see texture and detail....even though he paints on SILK! Then, he goes completely 180* in his photographs...which are huge macro abstractions.

While walking through New Jersey I met a veterinarian oncologist named Joshua Louis who in addition to devoting his life to companion animal cancer is a singer and songwriter, too. It was trail magic when our paths crossed and we began collaborating on a 'Puppy up!' song to share the inspiration from our travels. Dr. Joshua, as he's known, is a gifted pianist, soulful singer, and helped capture the spirit of our mission. He wasn't able to walk the final mile in Boston so I took his place on the stage and gave er all I got.

While Annabelle’s problem in the first book was dealing with a trend that became too popular (a rather nice problem to have), here she had to deal with a birthday party that became less popular every time the reader turns the page. Yet regardless of the different arcs, the themes of the two books are still similar. If our initial creative vision creates problems, we need to be resilient and come up with new ideas. In the end, it is our creative vision that allows us to express our individuality.

So back to my story, I was feeling very tired, very weak, with a sore throat and a throbbing headache starting up… and it was only Thursday… I rifled through the bag looking for this “cold” bottle and found it. I only looked at it long enough to read 쌍화탕 (ssang-hwa-tang) and wonder if I should drink part of it or all of it before I just downed the thing and passed the fudge out. That stuff works miracles. I had to take another pill for the headache later on, but otherwise I slept quite well. By morning I was not completely better, but I felt more like I usually do after a week of misery and fever – i.e. recovering. It didn’t taste too bad when I had it – there is a bit of a sting to the after taste but it’s tolerable. I was pretty desperate and feverish at the time though, so it could be awful for all I know. Apparently you should have 1 bottle a day and it will take care of most mild colds.

I can just imagine Stephen King standing in front of a corkboard with push pins and strings - constructing the web of who's fighting with who and who plays the pranks that set them off. The supernatural element of the novel is somewhat downplayed, so that the story can focus more on the characters and the effect that Gaunt's tricks are having on them. Yes, Gaunt is a demon who steals souls, and seems to know just about everything about everybody in town, and has eyes that frequently change color, and is able to repulse anybody with just a touch, but that is the real extent of the supernatural that we get. It's the characters that are really at the forefront here, and what is brought out in them when their biggest fears are shoved in their faces, and I love the way that King chose to present that with this story. It's a highly original idea and it completely works with what King was trying to say. His writing style in this book is also what most people refer to as "vintage King" - like he's slightly sophisticated but still naughty and nasty at the same time.
Yes, I’m probably guilty of them as well, and another dozen even worse.

America is a nation of mixed heritages, and nothing reflects that better than our holidays. Indeed, each one reflects a particular immigrant groups impact on our country. And, it should be noted, that these groups were not readily accepted in mainstream America. Each were discriminated against. Each were villianized by certain groups to be a threat against our ideals and principles. Such rubbish.

For the past few days I’ve been thinking about my calling. I am a minister in transition – meaning that I am not serving on a church staff at the moment. Because I seem to have spent so much time “in transition,” it feels natural to question my calling. The hymnals that I grew up with don’t offer all the verses to this hymn – and that may be a shame. Which ones do you know?

I was very tall and people would ask me how I got so tall. I didn’t know. They were brunette. I was blonde. People would even say that I looked like my a-dad but I couldn’t help but thinking each time I looked in the mirror; “Whose eyes are those “?
This year I decided to try something different. Earlier in the year I took some shots from the Holyrood side of the Radical Road around Salisbury Crags trying to get traffic light trails with a backdrop of the Parliament and Calton Hill. The idea struck me, why not try and combine the two? So that’s what I did. 2 cameras set up, D7000 with the Sigma 70-200mm shooting Calton close in in portrait format, the D90 with the Nikon 18-200mm lens shooting the wide scene on 15s exposures to get the light trails and the fireworks. And guess what? It worked. Exactly the shot I wanted and something I’ve not seen done before.
“Meanwhile Matthew Shardlake is given an intriguing legal case by an old servant of Queen Catherine Parr, which will lead him into the corrupt labyrinth of the King’s Court of Wards. Asked to investigate claims of ‘monstrous wrongs’ committed against his young ward Hugh Curteys by Sir Nicholas Hobbey, a Hampshire landowner, which have already involved one mysterious death, Shardlake and his assistant, Barak, journey to Portsmouth. Shardlake has taken the case, despite the imminent threat of invasion, as it also gives him the opportunity to investigate the mysterious past of Ellen Fettiplace, a young woman incarcerated in the Bedlam whom he has befriended and whose family once lived nearby.

The final thing that I think will safeguard your marriage is regular church attendance. The reason I feel this way is because our church is our family. I've shared many times how they came along side of us when we were falling apart. We have amazing examples of godly marriages in our lives! People we've come to respect and love so deeply. Going to church has also reminded us often to get our eyes off of ourselves and onto God. EVERY time we quit looking at ourselves we see God do amazing things in our marriage.

Thus Sheldon’s In His Steps and the tremendous evangelism of Dwight Moody certainly establish their interest in bringing salvation to drunks and watching them be healed of their addiction. In the eyes of these Christians, drunks were not “powerless;” they were in need of a new birth accompanied by spiritual, mental, and physical wholeness, forgiveness, and healing. Something not accomplished by “mind cure”or pseudo “conversion,” but by asking—as Christians and sons of God–for, and receiving healing from a loving Creator.

I hope I can teach my little girl that in the same way that we tend to and care for our flowers and plants that we need to tend to and care for our spirit. I hope I can teach her that praying and reading her bible is like watering a thirsty flower and it will refresh her and give her strength. I hope I can show her through example that in the same way we pull the weeds in our garden that try to hinder the plants growth, we need to pull the weeds in our lives that hinder our growth and spiritual health. I hope that I can teach her to pull weeds of fear. Pull weeds of hatred. Pull weeds of gossip, envy and strife. I hope I can teach her to pull weeds of pride and of shame to make room for the fruits of the spirit to grow and thrive in her. It is not easy to hold on to these virtues or on to faith at times. The weeds are always popping up, the dry seasons come, the storms beat down and the pests attack. When those times come for my little one, I hope she will remember that she is never alone. The gardener will always be there to protect and strengthen her. The gardener never gives up on His garden and under his care all things thrive. Jesus.

"They take a drum kit and break it up among the three of them, and then they set up along the front of the stage. So, whoever is playing bass (James and James alternate between bass and guitar,) is also stepping on a kick drum…and whoever is playing guitar is also stepping on the high hat (and sometimes playing harmonica simultaneously). Heather, in the middle, switches between melodica, keys, glockenspiel and snare drum, often playing several at a time. And even with all this going on, their harmonies are astounding."

After getting nice and groovy in the Do Lab for Christian Martin it was time to skip on down to the beloved Sahara Tent. Zeds Dead was about to take the stage and I cannot tell you just how hard these guys throw down. This being my second time seeing them (both in festival settings), they proved yet again why they are my favorite dubstep artists. The two, along with vocalist/mc Omar LinX threw down a hell of a set aside from the little mishap in the video (it was actually refreshing to see proving they are mixing live). Going straight into “Oh thats unexpected” (The Beginning – Zeds Dead). They earned the # 3 spot in the top 3 for day 2.

Now I love Paulaner beers so I was rather excited about the prospects of this liter. But it was a disappointment. The menu said that the beer was "homebrewed", probably an awkward translation from Chinese which I took to mean brewed either on the premises (although I saw no evidence of such equipment) or at least in country. Whatever it meant, the result was disappointing. The beer did not taste fresh. The characteristic malt profile of a German beer was entirely missing and the hop character was out of balance, with a sort of "edge" to it that made the drink rather unpleasant. And it was darn expensive to boot.
Kaden started off the trip with a befuddled look of concern on his face, as he often does when we go to a new place. He is a very observant child, and he just sort of quietly takes in new surroundings. He warmed up a bit towards the end though, and I think he had a lot of fun. He tried to ingest two seashells, but luckily Uncle Tyler and Aunt Lauren caught this before he choked to death. He wasn't too interested in eating the sand. Mostly he just held out his fingers and looked at me with an expression that seemed to be asking, "Why aren't you wiping this mess off of me?" We didn't get to the beach until his afternoon nap time, so he did surprisingly well staying content with a missed nap--I guess that is the beauty of distraction.

I've been wanting to experiment with diaper bags for a long time. I've never made a handbag or diaper bag before so it was a little out of my comfort zone. Well this morning I woke up at 4:30 and could not go back to sleep. With the kids still asleep I figured this would be a great time to get some sewing done so I went to work in my studio and after some seam ripping and adjusting and just plain ol' messing around, THIS is what I came up with!
Then I was flat on my back. I had the sparkly checkerboards of recovering consciousness dancing around the edges of my vision, and Jeff was standing over me. He looked genuinely concerned as he played the instrumental part while tapping me with his foot.
I have also been thinking about the important psychological shift that this implies. If we are in a crisis that the economists, big businesses, investors, bankers, politicians and government are going to resolve and bring us out of, then we are waiting for others to resolve our personal woes. We make others responsible for us finding a job; for us being able to obtain or maintain a home, whether renting or buying one; for us to lack the fear to start or invest in something new. However if we stop using the word crisis and accept that this is the new reality and realize that these are the new times and circumstances that are ours to live, then all of a sudden the responsibility to move forward in life is our own.

We're heading up to my grandparents tomorrow morning to spend Christmas with them and my aunt, uncle and cousins. Dad only has until Sunday off, so it will be a short trip.

We're opening presents tonight and having a neighbor lady over for supper and possibly going roller-skating as a family (the 4-H program is having a "Christmas party" w/ roller-skating) but I doubt there will be that many people there. It should be fun though.

Too often organizations exist to push paper and send emails to protect the back side of bureaucrats. Unfortunately bureaucrats are focused on the organizational chart, titles and how to move up the ladder. Leaders exist to make a difference in the lives of individuals. And sometimes the leader is not even aware of his / her contribution to the organization or to the lives of the individuals that are touched by the leader.

Well, now, here's a bit of a puzzle. A modest web search indicates that there used to be a 306 running between Crystal Palace and Blackheath, until 1996; but then again, there seems also to have been a 306 running between New Barnet and Leavesden. Both these areas count as London nowadays; suffice it to say, however, that there is no such route in the TfL world now but, as it our habit, we feel we should mark its non-existence.

The same is true concerning our feelings of inner security. If we have been programmed to believe that we are not safe alone in the world without our partner, we become a burden on him or her. (This is regardless of the fact that the other may get energy from our dependence.) This does not help either of us. We are denying our real selves, our real power, and our spiritual nature.
Before leaving the house I was trying to recall the name of the pub in Higham. According to the Internet it was the Greyhound - I knew it wasn't, because there are two, and it aint that one! The Internet, where everything is true, then told me it was called the Three Horseshoes. So this is all I had, along with a half remembered mental picture of the pub being near the cross. The Red Arrow follows the main road which passes the Greyhound, but then bypasses the old village centre. My only gripe about the Red Arrow is that its coaches don't seem to have a bell - anyone getting off thus far had just got up and announced their desire to disembark. I did this at seeing the Greyhound, and then waited 5 minutes for the bus to set off a goodly distance round the corner away from Higham village.
Because of Nana’s condition, rumors spread that the HerShe will disband.

But before it all ends, both bands had their farewell treat to the fans, promising a come back.

Also, flights out of Portland that connect to other, larger airports tend to leave early in the morning. Really early! In this instance, oh-dark-hundred translates to 5:30 a.m. Yesterday we left Tosca at the vet, where she will be boarded for the duration. Those of us who pay her bill think of it as the cat spa. I suspect, however, that she thinks of as her jail. They don’t spoil her to the degree that we do. Tosca taken care of, we headed south via a last-minute stop at LL Beans to Portland. Many of the motels around the airport offer a park-and-sleep package for less cost that we would pay to park at the airport for the two plus weeks of our trip. So we answered the Clarion motel’s call, ate an early supper, and each took a melatonin pill, which is supposed to induce sleep. It worked — we were both asleep before 7:30 p.m. — but whether that was the melatonin or all the activity surrounding getting us out of the office and away from Rotary paperwork and on the road for two weeks I cannot say.
Anyway, we waffled with teaching Dante the pledge beforehand without the 1950s Cold War era addendum but decided against it, believing that this would be a form of indoctrination that we, as Atheist parents, are completely against when it comes to religion and the like. Let him learn and say the Pledge, whatever. It's not going to turn him into an evangelist sidewalk bible thumper. Hell, I played the "virgin" Mary in a Xmas pageant when I was a kid and I turned out ok. I also recited the pledge throughout my elementary years and was not scarred from it. (Incidentally, I now do not say or stand for the pledge because I understand it to be a load of bullshit and I don't "pledge allegiance" to any flag or country.

I wish I could find the words to write about how I feel. Writing has always been my outlet, my way of sorting out my thoughts and figuring out my feelings. But it's just not working this time. Something's different. I feel lost, and I can't seem to find my way back. I hate this.
In the mean time, no, it's not ok to call 911 when you got into a wreck 5 days ago, with a shopping cart. Take a minute and think before you call 911 for something that is NOT an emergency.
The trouble with ripping people off is you never can tell who they are, how often they would have returned or how many friends they will tell to avoid the place. That is perhaps why this place was almost empty and El Federal was full.

That's a risky move for a bunch of guys in their mid to late 40s. The current commercial hip-hop community probably aren't paying attention to them (although they get respect from the people who have a sense of history... and the fact that Nas guests on "Too Many Rappers" doesn't hurt either). The production doesn't sound like it has an ear to 2011, or even 2001. It's kind of timeless: on one hand, it sounds like old-school electro hip-hop. On the other hand, it's very futuristic, but not in the Black Eyed Peas Euro-rave-Blade Runner way. They don't work with outside producers - they produce the tracks themselves. Not many other hip-hop acts produce their own albums.
Jesus, bless him, had absolutely without warning got into the taxi to tell my taxi-driver to come off drugs, because he was an addict and his life was a mess, and the taxi-driver did. Just like that. It was amazing. And now he drives a black Mercedes, which proves it, because before that he was driving a Ford Fiesta. (You see, as I had to work out for myself later when attempting to rationalise this story, it wasn't actually THIS taxi, because at that point the taxi-driver didn't have this one.) I have a feeling that Jesus did a pretty good job, as my taxi-driver seems like a very calm and nice individual.
Then we had our ward ( Church ) Christmas party. Not a tear was shed all day ( Well okay a brief one by Elayna, but it lated like 2 min, and Adam calmed her down fast YAY)!!

Here are some pictures for your enjoyment! Taken during Christmas of 2009!
Labour now stands with Fine Gael and Fianna Fail in supporting household and water charges – despite expensive media ads opposing them before the elections. Labour should be reminded of this cynical betrayal. Labour politicians who say they oppose the tax, but remain in a party pushing it through, can only be seen as opportunist. While Sinn Fein has said it opposes the household tax, it has unfortunately ruled out putting its resources behind supporting non-payment, which is the only way this rip-off can be defeated. This will no doubt disappoint many Sinn Fein voters.

I turn my phone off, look up and feel the warmth flood my face, my skin and enter each and every tiny tight pore. I should describe these gardens it seems selfish to keep their beauty for myself. The sky is, as always here, blue, a blue formed out of a mornings cool fog, the pines stand tall, aged bronze trunks sway sexily in the ‘almost there’ breeze. Agapanthus crowd together as they should, a plant that likes company, likes to whisper sweet nothings down the line, between them tall grasses brush past. A hard yellow steel shape poses as a work of art, look at me it demands, I am yellow, I am steel and I am made by man. I look down at my skinny pink jeans and wonder has that ship past? How do I dress anymore? Do I shriek or blend in with this my chosen environment?
Then we collapsed into a hug. I did it. I really did it. I ran a half marathon in under 2 hours. 1:57:33 officially. Turns out Kim had put 1:57:59 on the pace band. I'm so thankful for Kim, for everyone in the OPRC who believed in me, and everyone who came out to cheer.

Makes me paranoid about where my life is going actually. I still don't have a job, and to be honest gotten lazy with sending applications out. I could be doing things for myself that I'm not. I been mainly focusing on video games instead which is just silly, but easier than dealing with my problems. :X Also funny thing, I been working on getting more traffic for my blog but not posting as much as I would like to. Kind of defeats the purpose, heh.
Having dealt firsthand with the brutal effervescence of the music industry, Murray could have easily followed what those before him have done and succumbed to a life of playing music in noisy pubs to uncaring crowds. But a mere glimpse of the earnest passion in his eyes and you can see why the fable of the Boy Cried Wolf front man reads quite differently.

The LCWR national board agreed in 2002 to write letters of support to New Ways Ministry and chose as the theme for that year’s assembly “Leadership in Dynamic Tension.” In her presidential address to the assembly, Sister Kathleen Pruitt, CSJP continued the LCWR mantra that the Church needed to be reformed, and that LCWR sisters were the very people to do it: “The challenge to us, how best to speak clearly, to act effectively to bring about necessary change, reform, renewal, and healing within our wounded world, our nation, among ourselves, and particularly in our church.… Call for change or reform of structures, modes, and methods of acting that perpetuate exclusivity, secrecy, lack of honesty and openness, all of which foster inappropriate exercise of power, is tension-filled.”

Tuesday I had my annual physical and the cold had just hit me on Monday after severely pruning a 10 foot bush, actually two grown together like brambles. I left the doctor's office with three new prescriptions, none of which had anything to do with my cold since it's no doubt just a virus anyway. One of the meds I just started taking to treat suspected narcolepsy is a generic Ritalin. Yeah, you know that stuff they give kiddos for ADD? Well you've heard me talk about having CADD before, right? That crafter's attention deficit disorder that makes us flitter from one project to the next and the next and the next, never completing any of them. Well it should be interesting to see how this new drug effects my CADD. I can tell you that it is keeping me awake during the day (PRAISE GOD!!!) My boss actually thought I was joking when I told him I'd been falling asleep at work, then I had to explain that I never actually slept at my desk because I always got up and walked around or did something that kept me awake, but was constantly struggling to keep my eyes open and head up. My doc said it's most likely caused by the fibromyalgia, but could also be narcolepsy. As much as I detest taking medication, especially anything with potential side effects, when something interferes with my ability to carry out daily activities and responsibilities then it's time to take action. The other one I finally succumbed to was for my high cholesterol. With my weight and family history it was time to give in and take something that can lower it.

Diving is of course a raw nerve with Arsenal. Robert Pires is our most celebrated culprit and was castigated nearly a decade ago for the ease of his loss of footing. The Frenchman quickly learned and enhanced his reputation with this redemption. And this is before we consider our Brazilian Croat whose career was effectively ended by ill-founded and scurrilous Uefa claims backed by the media.

I often find myself watching the Food Network and seeing all of these amazing places. I’ll put the restaurant in a memo in my phone (an “in case you find your self in (insert area)” list) and often forget about it completely. THIS TIME I thought ahead for both of us. St. Pete has three restaurants, close to our hotel, that have been on various Food Network shows! Not only will you be able to go home and say you spent a week at a beautiful location, learned new strategies for working with adult learners, and met great people, you can also add that you ate at a restaurant that was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives!

My tree wasn’t far from my home. It was just down the trail from my front door and could easily be seen through our window panes. Stepping off of my porch it was merely a dash of ten seconds at top speed, which is often how I ran to the tree. Once there, I would kick off my shoes (which I barely needed anyway since it was so close, except that the path was rocky) and I would climb the lower branches that gradually wrapped upward around the back of the tree until I was able to slide down a main trunk onto a set of branches that led straight to the top as if they were purposely designed to give access to the feet of children. I would only have to dodge a branch here and there before I was at the top. And there I would sit in a crook of several branches that had grown together to form a cradle. Resting quietly, it took Mother’s call for a midday meal to rouse any interest in returning to the world below. In fact, it is possible that I would have gone hungry had she not beckoned my return.

Xu Guan’s mind was numb. The fine line between hallucinations and reality had been erased days before. Frequently, he would see his mother standing by the side of the road weeping and waving at him with a colorful scarf in her hand. His mother had always enjoyed colorful scarves, Xu Guan recalled as he tripped over a crack in the road and nearly fell to his knees.

Why is it that every time travel paradox movie that comes down the pike consists of two types? One is thoroughly plotted down to every minute so every possibility is covered - just to appease nit-picking geeks like yours truly - the other has a basic story line of action, drama, romance, whatever... and just happens to have a time traveling thread within its storyline, just so they can throw a bone to the phrase, "oh by the way: this all happens because they went back/forward in time".
I used the April kit from My Scrapbook Nook which contained all Crate Paper products from their Storyteller collection. I backed the photo with some corrugated cardboard & book paper & added a few rub-ons to the paper strips at the top of the page. Everything else is from the kit!

This is Orwellian reasoning, and were it coming from the mouths of the well-known players of the Bush administration (say Rumsfeld or Ashcroft), the left would quickly condemn it. As it stands, however, there’s been relatively little public outcry over this flagrant violation of Constitutionally guaranteed rights outlined in the 5th Amendment, which states clearly that the government cannot deprive citizens of life or liberty without due process, regardless of suspected criminal activity.
I'm hoping by Monday I'll be feeling all better. I HATE being sick!! I guess I can't complain too much, it's been a year since I was last sick. Tomorrow night I'm hosting our Dinner Club night.

“Hold your breath, O human child,” Glowgold commanded. He speedily encircled his prize student three times while touching the tip of his wand to her cloak. With each delicate contact, specks of light appeared on the plush fabric. The luminous dots began to twinkle and spin, like whirling stars. With closer inspection, Panther realized that the stars were actually tiny wheels, their eight spokes spiraling outward from a central hub. These spokes of light gave the cloak an unearthly appearance. The girl seemed to be wearing the night sky itself, only in miniature. As Panther exhaled deeply, Hannah pulled the hood down over her daughter’s brow. Glowgold gave the cloak a final tap, and a stunning constellation appeared over Panther’s enshrouded face.

All you do is click on the fish that have the short vowel in the middle that they are asking for, and the little submarine shoots it down. But that is ALL that it does. The idea that this helps kids practice reading words with short vowels is a fallacy, in my opinion, because my kids loved this game and only one of them can read any short vowel words. My helper told them to “find a word with an A in the middle,” etc. They liked to touch the word and watch it explode as the submarine shot it down. So it is really about visual discrimination.

So, on the recommendation of a 10+ year MS “sufferer”, I have called to arrange for my 1-week in-home trial of The Chi Machine. The description that follows is from Lighten Up Wellness, a local holistic and alternative health store here in Fort Wayne.
In that context, the Court states that if a third party were to procure the part of the source code or object code relating to the programming language or to the format of data files used in a computer program, and if that party were to create, with the aid of that code, similar elements in its own computer program, that conduct would be liable to be prohibited by the author of the program. In the present case, it is apparent from the explanations of the national court that WPL did not have access to the source code of SAS Institute’s program and did not carry out any decompilation of the object code of that program. It was only by means of observing, studying and testing the behaviour of SAS Institute’s program that WPL reproduced the functionality of that program by using the same programming language and the same format of data files.

I might publish the actual entries that I wrote as I counted down to what I believed then was my impending doom. I had read up enough on the thing to know that I had a three-month window between a hideous death and the possibility of a reprieve.
His movements masked by the din in the storefront, he shoved his bag through, then the shotgun. Next, with some difficulty, he pulled himself up to the window frame with sheer panic supplying his strength. In the back of his mind, he knew that the thing in the store would burst through the bathroom door any second and catch him hanging out of the window, defenseless. Gritting his teeth against the pain of his chest and back scraping against rough stone and metal, he wormed his way through the frame until he collapsed, gasping, on the brick pavement of the alley beside the store. Inside, the frantic wailing continued. Whatever was making the noise sounded angry. Seth closed the window with shaking hands, snatched his bag and gun, and set off, navigating his way further down the alley with only the sliver of moon in the sky to light his way.
Here's what I think people don't understand: Good hardly ever factors into popular or entertaining. People aren't going to youtube, for example, to watch someone do something meaningful or profound. They're going to watch some guy stick a lit firecracker up his bum. I would rather see Sharktopus than The English Patient. That's just how I roll.

We spent a long time yesterday cleaning out the front raised reds, pulling out lettuce and greens that were done and planting more seedlings. We've got lots of chard, kale, beets and carrots starting. I sowed lettuce and radishes yesterday. I still consider this an experimental year, so we'll see how well things do started now. I do know for sure we need to organize our plantings much better next year, also that we'll plant way fewer tomatoes since they took up a lot of space and haven't produced much.

You see, when I came out, and first told everyone about the transition, the first questions from everyone were about bathroom privileges, gender pronouns, and what the Hell my new name was gonna be! And I didn’t know just where it would fit in, I just knew that I was meant to be called Argiope. Pronounced properly, Ar -jye (or a soft G) -oh -pee, it was the name, I discovered, from a very intimidating, yet marvelous spider I once came across in Texas. Argiope. It just fit fit. But where?
One of my all time quick lunch-time favorites is a ham and butter sandwich, which just involves ham, butter, 1-2 tsp of dijon mustard, and a crusty baguette. I put the butter on one slice and the dijon mustard on the other slice, and obviously the ham in the middle. I like this sandwich best chilled, but eat it however you like. Don’t let the simplicity fool you, with high quality ingredients this sandwich is perfection!

Some so motivated by the agenda-makers they simply can no longer listen to or indeed see reason, they charge blind at a given enemy whilst the real villain rides past with impunity. Good god what an age we live in when even the common man has no bond, when all we have left are the years of our fathers because the present is so intolerably awful, we reach out to the past because they have given us no future, we tell tales of a better age because this one shames us, makes of us victims, hunted and prey. Better days then, no crime upon the street ,women walked unmolested and the little ones played in peace, the police served the people and neighbourliness existed, not as a ghost, a phantom, not as a spectre, conjured up in tales told by the aged, front-doors left open and a better world, a kinder world, a peoples world.

For a few years, I have been able to get discounts in some places where the age for “seniors” was 55 and over but most places were waiting for the somewhat magical change of age 60, at least. There are still some places that require you to be 65 before you get any discounts and luckily I am not there yet. Today I visited an old English Palace. I noticed on the prices right away that I qualified for the senior discount. Heavens sakes. I am counted a senior in foreign countries now also. Well, I am older but I haven’t gotten any stupider. I’ll take that discount, thank you. Don’t really need it today but might tomorrow.

It is the only explanation that makes sense the only thing that works with science.
If true, this is very troubling. There is case law indicating that the author retains all rights that have not been explicitly assigned to a publisher (the Tasini case), and a preliminary finding by a judge that says that pre-electronic rights contracts do not give publishers e-book rights simply because the contracts specified book rights (Random House, Inc. v. Rosetta Book LLC). While the issue is by no means resolved (unfortunately, Rosetta Books settled with Random House, and the actual dispute wasn’t litigated, so we don’t know for sure how the case would have turned out), that’s surely enough case law to indicate that for out-of-print works, the author is likely to be the rightsholder that HathiTrust (and projects like it) should be looking for.
I started out on a great foot when the expansion began. I knew that I knew my class, and I proved it over and over again. Even when things got rocky and the guild I was in switched to 10-mans, I did pretty well in every role I was asked to fill (which often ended up being healing).

But what is “time” but a fabrication of rotations in the 3rd Density?
Making a video to be uploaded in you tube is the next challenge. Those with more views, wins. Everybody prepares except Hong Joo. He’s so down lately ever since Nana was admitted in the hospital. Since DH2 is about helping friends, Hae Sung was the one who provided support to her dear friend this time. They went to visit Nana. It was really sweet that they transformed her room with cute designs on the wall! I’ve always enjoyed Hong Joo’s songs, it’s always a treat to hear his voice.
And it’s weird, but in the slowly-emerging picture of our narrator’s old life… she doesn’t sound like a coward. In fact, I keep picturing Steve McQueen. Steve might be dismayed that I have mentally cast him as a tiny Scottish blonde, but there is a clear Steve McQueen vibe coming through in her attitude. Specifically, Steve McQueen in The Great Escape: cracking wise, mouthing off, locked up in the cooler with his baseball and biding his time until the next escape attempt.
Further evidence of this influence, was sadly evident amongst a number of the victims appearing in the documentary, who, although they were filmed in shadow, were clearly mostly white girls. These young women, whilst describing what was done to them, referred to other abusive events and relationships, which fell just short of rape, as if they were a natural and expected feature of the female interaction with the male.
Apparently, Bush is still our president.
#2: I don't really know what to say after that. Except that hunting for jobs is no fun. Really. This is the very first time in my job career that I've had three interviews, but no solid job offers. High ho, high ho, it's retail or food I go.
With this the boy’s father was speechless. Then his son added, "Thanks dad for showing me how poor we are."
When I saw I Love You, Man, I loved it. I loved that Paul Rudd has become a leading man, I loved that Andy Samberg was funny yet restrained, I loved the female power trio friendship, and I loved the supporting appearances from Joe Lo Truglio, Thomas Lennon, and Lou Ferrigno. But then I started to rethink it. Was the bromance too indulgent? Did I like Jason Segel as this character? I prefer him as an oddly suave jerk. Ultimately, I Love You, Man is not too self-indulgent, though it teeters precariously close to being so and other bromance movies would be wise to tread cautiously, if at all, and I guess I will just have to live with this character type of Jason Segel’s. And how can I argue with Rush?

There is a point at which a person begins to question their own mortality and the legacy that they will leave behind. However after hearing from my doctor that I am once again in fantastic shape, I am going to borrow a scene from the 1995 movie, “Grumpy Old Men.” I have no doubt in my mind that I will live to turned 95 years old, exercise most days in my life. Every morning, I will wake up, and eat five strips of bacon. And for lunch, I will eat a bacon sandwich. And for a midday snack?

If Harper does open the season in the bigs, his success will be a key to the Nationals. Also getting more production out of last year’s big free agent signee Jayson Werth (.232, 20 HRs in 2011) will also be important for Washington’s chances.
Next up, I think I'll match a few of these ideas up against my 'criteria for a good campaign' and see which one has the most promise.
And a second entry for "the good": last night's dinner. How many of you were readers of the late, lamented Gourmet Magazine? My guess is most of you. It kills me that when I sold my house in 2008 to move in with my now-husband, I recycled almost a hundred issues of Gourmet because I didn't want to move them. I figured that there were plenty more issues to come, right? A year later Gourmet stopped publication.

Starting solids Attention preemie moms but of course I would love feedback from everyone. What is your view on solids? Did you do purees? How old was your baby when you started? Preemie moms: did you wait til your child reached the appropriate adjusted age, or actual age? I'm having a bit of an internal battle with this. Turtle-Love will be 6 months in 2 weeks. He is sitting supported and has some moments of balancing upright on his own. He salivates at the table when we eat and stares hardcore at food. We have been letting him hold breads for a couple weeks but he wasn't interested in putting them in his mouth. I've spoon feed him formula supplements a couple times to see how he does with the spoon, btw he loves it and grunts and whines if I'm not fast enough. The past three times we have handed him a bread item (a biscuit, a pizza crust, a cracker) he has put them in has mouth - I made it a game and took it from him before he could ingest anything. The last thing we gave him was a cracker 2 days ago - he slobbered on it and broke a piece off. I was terrified at first, and then watched him chew it! I made it a game again, and fished it out lol. He thought it was funny. Originally, I wanted to wait until his 6 month appointment to see what the doctor said about starting him on solids - mainly because he is a preemie and I worry about his digestive system being ready. He has given me tons of signs he is ready though. I'm just not sure. I know I'd like to make my own baby food when we get to that point.
4. What will it take to optimize this space? Think of the resources required – time, elbow grease, a strong back, some helping hands, money, etc.

I know. I probably shouldn't let them sleep in my bed as often as I do...but they are just too snuggly to resist. This is how they fell asleep the other night. As close as possible. Just the way I love them to be.
"Whatever the cause,” said Cahill, “it’s not recent. The causal event obviously happened around nine or ten months ago – that’s when people stopped getting pregnant. There may be a small chance that we can get some idea of what’s going on if we look at records of possible outbreaks or unusual activity between nine and ten months ago. Maybe -"

The man who penned the Wenceslas ditty, John Mason Neale, did change around a song to tell his story. He actually took an old spring song and dumped those lyrics, replacing them with the good king. Here's the timeline on the whole shebang: Duke Wenceslas the actual person, early 10th century, Old Spring song ("Now is the time for flowering"), early 16th century, Good King Wenceslas, the Christmas Carol, 1853.

The cancellation of the contract is a first step in the process of resituating post-Mubarak Egypt’s relationship with Israel. While in Cairo recently, I asked a 21-year-old Al-Azhar University student, Mohammed, about his feelings towards Israel. “We have been in two wars,” he said. ‘They killed five of our border guards last year. Mubarak sold Israel the material to build the separation wall between Israel and the West Bank.’
You'll have to excuse me. Because I spent the entire day at an HR seminar listening to this lady with amazingly awesome hair talk about things like FMLA and reasonable accommodation and exempt versus non-exempt employees. It was thrilling.

We've done the paperwork to release our hospital records/MRI's and EEG, the kids have to have some blood drawn, and now I'm getting through the phone interview portion of it. It's supposed to take aprox 2-4 hours, but I've got 3 kids . . . so it's kinda long. Yesterday morning I was on the phone for a couple hours, mostly talking about the specific symptoms of Halle's seizures. I wasn't prepared for the sudden emotion that kicked me in the gut. Maybe I should have expected it but I felt totally drained and depressed the rest of the day. However, I am not complaining. I just am SO GRATEFUL they are actively working on figuring things out.

I love crunch bars and my darling knows that but besides that he knows my odd love of non-uniformly shaped chocolate pieces. I even eat kit kat bars by biting into them instead of breaking the sticks apart. If any of you have ever had a chocolate orange? My favorite part is the core. So pretty much these oddly shaped blocks of chocolate covered in crispy rice are my dream come true. These are making my mouth water and I may have to go out and buy some crunch bars and forget my diet today. One reviewer of these said they were better than crunch bars even! YUM!

The only thing that can be deduced from all of this is the fact our Parliament is now so hamstrung and subservient to the EU it should turned into a play area where tourist and visitors can do the Parliament thing.
At any rate, when it comes to territorial integrity, Iranians have always shown a firm stance and demonstrated that they will not retreat an iota from their rights. In the 1980s when the United States and several European countries backed and equipped the late dictator Saddam Hussein in the war which he waged on Iran, the Iranians didn’t surrender an inch of their soil to the enemy.

If the tender family moments aren't your thing, then the mystery will be. The author does an awesome job painting everyone as a suspect. Just when you think someone is cleared, more evidence is thrown their way to cast them in an entirely new bad light. I'm not sure I'd have guessed this time around who was doing the killing and I liked it. The ending brought the story to a statisfying close and I was happy to see Vee gain control over her ability to slide so she can learn to cope with it in the future.

remonstration but Beldam simply smiled,
There have been a lot of fall starts in the Buffalo Bills’ search for a franchise quarterback to replace Hall-of-Famer Jim Kelly. They thought they had one in 3rd round pick Todd Collins in 1995. He didn’t work out. They thought they had one when they traded the #9 pick in the 1998 NFL draft for Jaguars back-up Rob Johnson. He didn’t work out. They thought they had one when they traded their 2003 1st round pick to the New England Patriots for Drew Bledsoe. He didn’t quite work out either.
So, as we journey along the way we felt it best to share of work on this case…
Even so, this was very nice.

“I just went there over the holday weekend. Still unparalleled. Absolutely the best. Awesome. I grew up on this pizza. I live in VA now. The pizza near DC is fairly unimpressive.

I can't even begin to express into words on this blog how hard this has been. Not only on me, but my sweet Dad who loves her so much and doesn't know how to make it without her. (But you will Daddy, you will. Momma would want you to, and Theresa and I both want and need you) My sister, who even though they didn't always see eye to eye, it was her Momma too, and my sweet wonderful daughter, who thought the world of her Grandma and who was my daughter's favorite playmate when she was a toddler! We are all in a world of hurt even still.
This has failed to rise in the convection oven of the slush pile. In fact, you need a new recipe.
When I first got my condo and lived with my roommate our place was clean almost all the time! No pets and no kids certainly helped that. Somehow we managed to do the dishes and keep the trash picked up and for the most part everything had a place and stayed in that place…. Over the next 5 years or so things changed, a lot … My roomate moved out, I got a cat, then another, then I got married, then we got a dog, then we got a new roommate, then we got another dog then our condo had too much stuff and we had to move. :/ We moved and had several roommates in and out throughout the years, managed to get THREE more dogs and have a baby!

Should you be worried about taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen for soreness after a good workout or training session? Yes. After all, they’re drugs and some studies show that when used for this purpose they aren’t even effective.

In her voice over at the end of the episode she tells us that Devon doesn't deserve Nova (word) and that she doesn't want anything to do with him. She realizes it's never going to work out with him (gee, what was your first clue?). She's focused on her education and is grateful to her mom for everything she's done for her. She wants the best for her own daughter and knows more than a high school diploma is the only way she can really provide that best for Nova.

We're celebrating Richard's birthday so we move on in search of dessert. A quick scout around the dessert menus in the area leads us to Ash St Cellar. I saw the crazy eyes in Richard when he spotted the chocolate and dart tart on display in the window.
One thing that I look for in running gear is not paying a crap load of money for something that I can just make myself. Remember when I made my own sparkle headbands. There are a lot of places out there where I can buy something similar to what I made in this attempt with the sparkly top and velvet underside, but Punkeelove has some special stuff going on that made the purchase worth it for me.

Sophie Joy : " I've been needing to get glasses for a while now... I can barely see 5 metres in front of me which is becoming a slight issue. Specsavers were trying to convince me to buy, not one, but TWO pairs of their shitty, shitty frames for a bargain of $60. I kindly refused and I said "These are fucking hideous" and walked out. But these Derek Cardigan frames have definitely taken my fancy. And I also love cardigans which is an added bonus. Make my first pair of glasses the best pair of glasses I'll ever have. LOVE."
As I said already, it seems as if you are always smiling and you have the sweetest giggle! Your ticklish spot is around your rib cage on the right side. Gets you everytime!!! You started "waving" at yourself last month and I think it is hilarious! You also pat me on the back whenever I am holding you on my shoulder, just as I do to you. You are still in Mommy & Daddy's room, but soon that is going to change. Daddy said it's time for you to get some use out of your crib, but I am sad to see you go. I know we will all rest better, I just hope you keep up your good sleeping habits! I love that you sleep late in the morning - just like your Mommy :)

The other day I was in the grocery store, zooming around trying to fit in shopping while running late for a game and preparing for a party later. You know, the regular "being a woman" stuff. I am careful when I'm in zoom mode not to cut people off, run them over or be rude. So I was zooming around people in the produce department and some old, slow man says to me, "Just take it easy and slow down." WTF? Did I say to you, "He pokey get the frick out of the way - try caffeine you might move faster than 0.0001 mph!!"
These handmade crocheted ornaments are so very dear to me. I think they were the last thing my grandmother made for me before she died. I have been decorating this tree with these ornaments ever since. I place this tree at the end of our upstairs hallway and it is also part of my outdoor scheme when lit in the evening. This tree is viewed from the front of my house.
This approach worked, and as well as keeping the Harveys and Larkins drinkers happy I was able to introduce other customers to the delights of brews from both near and far. Near, included the likes of Westerham and Hog's Back, who's beers I took on a fairly regular basis, whilst beers from further afield were primarily sourced through Beer Seller, now known as Waverley TBS, who offered monthly promotions on a wide range of cask ales from both micro breweries and established regionals.
Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees. Slather the ribs with BBQ sauce and lay them on a baking sheet. Put the ribs back in the oven for just about 10 minutes so the sauce can get a bit charred. Alternatively, you can cook the sauce-covered ribs on a grill or in a grill pan.
So who do you vote for? Of these caricatures – assuming nothing further about their policies, about their parties, about other matters: do you vote for the candidate whose actions benefit people but whose words insult and injure you, or do you vote for a candidate whose actions are to the detriment of many (including you) but whose words flatter and praise you?
Leo Leo Leo- Never ever cared for him that much, in fact, pardon the pun but I never got on the Leo boat. I didn't really appreciate him until I saw him on Oprah touting flourescent lightbulbs and hybrid cars. You could just tell he really did care about something other than himself, which for women who care about other things other than what bra size their sportin', and where the next botox shot will go, this is like a pheromone. Throw in some tears from the Leo man, and it's all over for any standoffishness.
KCI Licensing Inc and others v Smith & Nephew and others was decided last Thursday by Judge Colin Birss QC, sitting as a judge in the Patents Court, England and Wales). Following earlier litigation in which KCI had pursued Smith & Nephew (S&N) for infringing two of its European patents and established that infringement had occurred, the company applied for summary judgment in relation to an enquiry into damages. In its particulars of claim in the infringement proceedings, KCI had asserted that it was the registered patent holder. S&N admitted that assertion at the time but now, in its response to KCI's statement of intent in the enquiry into damages, S&N claimed that KCI was not the true patent owner after all. KCI was not impressed and argued that it was surely not open to S&N to raise the issue of true ownership on the enquiry into damages -- not just because of the earlier admission but also because it in any event was estopped from doing so. No, said S&N: it had actually raised the point in its skeleton argument at the trial and the admission was only that KCI was on the register as its registered proprietor, not that KCI was its true patent owner.

Penny Pritzker, mother of subprime lenders, the woman whose bank was seized in 2001, the woman who owes the federal government nearly a half billion dollars, and just one more of Barack Obama’s dubious friends has turned down the opportunity to be Barack Obama’s Department of Commerce honcho. That was wise of her because I just don’t think, CNN and MSNBC aside, America was going to stand for an appointment of this character. I covered this idea here this morning. I just find it unbelievable that this woman’s name would even land in the hat for ANY appointment.
The issue will now be over the scope and breadth of the injunction that courts are prepared to grant. The ECJ has recognized that this is a matter for national law, but it remains to be seen whether Member States will apply this in a consistent manner.

I felt defeated. I felt like after all this, with only 3.5K left, I was going to have to walk the rest of the way. I would jog a little, but my legs wouldn’t let me go. People I passed long ago were all passing me. I thought that the boyfriend, his sister and his dad had to be done by now.

This Thanksgiving we had tandoori chicken with stuffing. I used 2 cornish chicken for making this dish. It’s really easy , if you can marinate it over night that would be great . The yogurt should be thick so that the marinade holds on to the chicken, for that what I do is put it on my tea stariner and let it sit for atleast an hr. That really does the trick, it comes out really thick. Hope you all will like it.

I'm slowly learning to say those three words faster, easier, to not withhold them from those I love. To be quick to own up to my own failings, whatever they may be, however big or little they were in the scenario. To be the person who steps up and starts the dialogue by taking responsibility for the situation. It's not the easiest way, and requires a degree of vulnerability that I don't think any of us are comfortable with. But it does work. And it kinda makes me think about the way Jesus lived His life-- He said "It's my fault" when it wasn't. And I am so glad He did.
One could myth bust all day, and I've done some of it around here. The myths about taxation and how little the "rich" pay is one of my frequent topics (here, for 'zample). Today, I want to take on one of things you'll hear every day.
I'm about ready to throw in the towel and declare our home a completely sweetener-free zone, focusing only on fruits to satisfy our family's sweet teeth. BUT, that doesn't work when you have kids that are old enough to remember the allure of the frozen yogurt, jelly beans, candy bars, and Halloween candy they ate just weeks ago.

See, for all their speed, aggression and ferocity, Slayer are a band of accomplished musicians who know their way around their instruments and how to put a song together. Many bands cite Slayer, and especially the album Reign In Blood, as being a major influence on their song writing. Their have been many Thrash releases since Reign In Blood and not one of them comes close to being what this album is, not even Slayer‘s own releases.

First we met at their school, Scipione Maffei. They had made this welcome sign for us! Look at the Moomins they drew! :-D The vice rector gave us a welcome speech and after that we were already headed for our first place to visit.
My father didn't have an external need for accurate time, no job or medical reason that things had to be done precisely. My dad was a mild OCD type, a recorder, and I didn't realize how much of one until after he died in 2010. I put a new battery in the kitchen clock for my mother a few weeks ago, and found, taped to the back, a list of all the times he'd re-set the clock, and how much it was off by...according to CHU, no doubt.
My friend asked me the other day: If you messed up on several tests, and were pretty sure that you had a close to zero percent chance of rescuing you grade in that class, what would you do?
After this conversation it still was not very clear to me what happened and I decide to talk with Mrs. T myself in the morning to try and get to the bottom of things. I mean, clearly Oscar was fine, but I just wanted to know what happened, and to let them know that I was not comfortable with them leaving him asleep in the lunch bunch room by himself. I was not angry or anything, but that's just not okay and I wanted to be clear with them that it was not okay.

Via may it be homelessness/hungar/unemployments….etc…we know the list here Chelas dont we? What I AM suggesting to you is to CHANGE your “thought/vibrational feelings and directional flows of that pure energy and apply it DIRECTLY to your “CAUSE” thru by doing of such you will more of an immediate see the “EFFECT” of that energy exchange within this group of cycled energies.

Since its inauguration to public worship in December 1986, the Bahá’í House of Worship in Delhi has, as of late 2002, attracted more than 50 million visitors, making it one of the most visited buildings in the world. Its numbers of visitors during those years surpassed those of the Eiffel Tower and theTaj Mahal. On Hindu holy days, it has drawn as many as 150,000 people; it welcomes four million visitors each year (about 13,000 every day or 9 every minute).
Behind the principle of the analogy of faith is the prior confidence that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. If it is the Word of God, it must therefore be consistent and coherent. Cynics, however, say that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. If that were true, then we would have to say that the smallest mind of all is the mind of God.

A Franzenian footnote: On Monday I was in London, and the Tube was mostly shut down due to striking. During my train journey home, I read that Jonathan Franzen had accidentally wandered into the Tube shut-down when his chauffeured car hadn’t shown up. There was something about the congruence of me and Jonathan Franzen – both affected by the strike; both out walking the London streets – that just amused me. Without a doubt, the freedom of workers to strike adversely affects the freedom of commuters to get around the crowded city. And yet, compared to the sardine tin of the Tube, it really did feel liberating to stride down Oxford Street!

Insufficiently noticed in the public furor over PMCs like Blackwater was the difference in motivation between them and the Pentagon. Whereas the stated goal of Rumsfeld and the armed forces in Iraq was to end violence there, the PMCs clearly had a financial stake in its continuation. Hence it is no surprise that some of the largest PMCs were also political supporters for pursuing the ill-conceived “War on Terror.”
About a half hour later, Samuel had drifted off to sleep but was woken and sat up. His back was covered in hives. Kevin and I were shocked to see the reaction had come back and was worse than before. We called for the PA and sat and watched as more hives appeared on his face, neck and torso. It was wild to see them just pop up so quickly.

Meanwhile, Anthony’s defense filed a motion on Friday with Orange County Circuit Court, seeking more phone records from a dozen people involved in the case. The motion asks for any and all records for “phone calls, text messages, P2P communications, Internet usage, WAP usage, and cell tower pings.”
It is my opinion (agreeing with Tabletalk writers) that “Jesus’ spirit never went to hell, but on the cross He suffered the full wrath of God that is poured out in hell.” And even with all of that physical pain, the most intense suffering he endured came when he lost the gaze of his Father in heaven, causing him to cry out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” I shudder even as I type this.

Apart from visual phenomena, most people can relate to the brain playing tricks when it comes to sound, where, for example, we hear a sound that we are sure is coming from nearby, when in fact the sound is very far away. Or, we hear the sound of a big truck from afar and “earthquake” instantly comes to mind. I can recall an occasion where I had obviously been thinking about somebody and then the phone rang. I was probably subconsciously wishing that the person who called would be the person I was thinking of, so of course, my brain made sure that the voice sounded so much like the person’s, when upon reflection it didn’t..

Now I am an old-fashioned girl. I told him that I would take his last name, but I didn't want our kids to have it (HAHAHA - this was back when I thought I could reproduce). Being Mexican has some negative stereotypes attached to it, which I didn't want to saddle my kids with. Plus they will speak English, so they wouldn't be able to read their junk mail.

When my mother then my sister picked up the book, I began to feel like there was a Game of Thrones plague about and I was determined not to catch it. Yet there was a whisper on the wind and it said,
A charter member of the just-announced (to excitement so deafening it’s inaudible) MCOTD Hall of Fame, he’s being celebrated tonight at a concert, in Chicago’s Millenium Park, featuring musicians who came up under him, including saxophonists Steve Coleman and Eric Alexander.

But Holder and Obama’s anti-Wall Street “law and order” rhetoric has turned out to be a smokescreen that allows the Obama campaign to talk the talk of the 99% while taking money from Wall Street’s 1%. The result is extortion by proxy. As President Obama put it to the Big Finance executives who met with him at the White House just two months into his presidency, “My Administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.”
So if I get all this done....I'm going to have a backyard BBQ. I can see shopping for paper lanterns and lights next. :))))

That’s what Knudson’s privatization, farming out to corporations… comes down to. Teachers have little say in how educational programs are designed. This has to change. Return education to the educators and communities. There are many problems that have to be addressed in securing financial support. Blue Cross, University of Pennsylvania… pay NO property taxes. The whole tax structure in the city needs to change… but First Order of Business must be to STOP the Knudson plan. There is no room for negotiation or modification—it MUST be stopped. General agreement on this, and first deadline is May 31—vote will be June 1. So we are under severe time pressure. How is this to be done? Build Show Sustain
Thank you everyone for you kindness and generosity! I will be doing this again next spring with hopefully even bigger and better blog candy!
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
So this has taken the wind out of my sails I must admit. I do feel down about it all but know I now need to be very strict (I have been slacking a bit on writing down everything I eat and the exercise eased up a bit last week too) with everything and really push on. I can't be demoralised by it - look at the people who lose 10 stone and then have to lose another 10 stone to reach goal weight. That must be demoralising.
I tend to use any form of communication available as a platform for the most interesting topic on my mind (in my opinion). For this post I’m going to slow down and go back to the basics in term of a) my 7 goals, and b) my ‘radical’ moment this week.
People’s sense of civilization is definitely tested because of the brutal act that happened at the playground, with the parents linking it to what’s happening with children in Africa, and their individual takes on that is quite eye-opening. It also sheds light on how people can change as a result of marriage or having children and I think it would be interesting for viewers to identify with the characters and the many parallels they may have with each individual, because any adult in their 30′s or 40′s must have gone through at least one aspect of each of these character’s lives. It’s definitely a wonderful character study and it’s not just a one-timer, because you can always watch it again and find something about each character that you may have not caught a glimpse of before, and that’s what makes a truly great film.
Dear John
After just a few minutes of Googling, followed by some hurried IMs with a guy calling himself "Brother SelloutImust," we discovered the real cause of the fire: one monk (we’ll call him “Wholier Then Thou”) reneged on a deal he signed with the Devil back in July of 1987 for... yup, you guessed it - his soul. Details of their back room deal are sketchy, but Brother SelloutImust swears (profusely) that it involved pole dancers, fruit roll ups, and a clown suit.

After a weekend of absorbing a volcanic eruption of NFL draft news, I laughed the loudest or shook my head the most at the following five items.
Ben Lethbridge doesn’t have many vices left. After raising his little sister to adulthood, he wasted no time making up for the youth he lost to responsible parenting. Two years of partying it up—and ignoring his diabetes—has left him tethered to a home dialysis regimen.

We may have complained about getting up at four in the morning to go to Phoenix, AZ. but once we were on the flight, our vacation had started. Flying was part of the vacation not like now where it is something to live through with great dread and anticipation. Was there a difference in first-class and economy? Sure, but either was fine. We always went economy (and we could stretch across 3-4 seats back then) until one day I think we begged our dad to try first class, it was a matter of twelve or eight dollars per person. It was hard to go back to economy after that.

In using subversive elements for da'wa, Muslims might comfortably use false arguments to turn Mexicans against their northern neighbors. They might, for instance, argue that Islam is a religion of "racial equality," whereas Christianity is the "white man's" religion, imposed on their ancestors by racist whites who sought to keep them "impoverished" beyond the border. Islamist strategies in Mexico amount to trying to win the unbelievers over to their side, whether through conversion or just cooperation. For those who refuse to cooperate, they are infidels to be used in any way that seems fit.
It’s also amusing to watch Ohio State and UC fans throw around words like “cheaters” and “punks” at Kentucky basketball. Never mind that Ohio State basketball has been on probation much more recently than Kentucky (2006 for three years) and that Tressel resigned in shame as the Buckeyes head football coach after it was revealed that sweater vest full of integrity knowingly played ineligible players and lied to his athletics director and the NCAA about it (find something like that in John Calipari’s past, I dare you).

The sad thing is that, as with the women's 60 meter final at the US Indoor Championships where a false start was called on Lisa Barber, the second start of the race went off without incident. And Ms Barber - who also ran under protest - got no advantage over the other athletes and finished in third position. Which based on her performances over the course of the season was where she should have finished. Unfortunately in that instance, Barber was not awarded third as her original false start was upheld - even though she got NO advantage in the final!
One thing that this study proves is that through the use of nonlinear time series analysis, randomness in the EEG tracings can be quantified.

Verbal art is a complex subject and as with a lot of things we are discussing my goal is just to give you a foundation in order for you to explore the idea more and develop it in to your own skill set. Communication is not just done with words it involves hand gestures, facial expressions, body positioning as well as many other factors. In order to be effective with your verbal art you have to learn to observe every aspect of the situation and the buyer to be able to take advantage of everything you see.

Really. It's a blast. It will make you, yeah, smile.
The Guidebook is what every fan is waiting to see. As The Shadow over Innsmouth was written from an outsider’s point of view, the reader never knows for certain what’s going on behind those shuttered windows and closed doors in Innsmouth and here Ross has the opportunity to inform him. Unfortunately, the results are neither surprising or particularly inspired. To be fair, however, given the subject of the supplement, he can’t stray too far afield for fear of upsetting the expectations of the audience. We get the expected Deep One hybrids shut away in attics and basements, the malicious Marsh clan, crumbling factories containing secrets, the Gilman House Hotel, and Joe Sargent’s bus. The occupants of Innsmouth are largely dangerous with a few rare allies for the investigators to befriend.
Yes, many people will say that patience is useful in this writing industry and I am one of them. There is always something that will make writers (and others) wait. And it's not easy, but we have to face the existence of nerves and the battle where patience is the weapon.
The hardest thing to explain to someone who’s never performed is how much you have to feel. How you aren’t just showing others what it’s like to feel what you do or be where you were, but creating enough of that emotion that it reaches out and touches them. I don’t get up on stage and sing for me – I sing and feel and exert energy for every person in that room. In order to do that, to put so much into five or fifteen or forty five minutes, I have to believe that it’s worth it. I have to blindly invest every bit of my heart and my energy and my faith in the fact that what I am doing matters to someone, because 99% of the time, nobody else is going to tell me that it does. I don’t get a score or a grade or even a response sometimes. I just have to turn my face upwards and believe that they are listening, even when I can’t see them.

Tonight as my youngest brother and I drove around for a while, he lit up as much as the lights we were viewing. He was recounting to me the many times our mother described lights on the “lane” and it was endearing. Maybe that is why I prefer the colored lights so much, it relights those memories long forgotten.

Now, the easy explanation would be to assume that job growth is occurring in the, you know, manly sector: construction, mining, manufacturing, the heavy-lifting kinds of jobs. But what’s curious here is that men are also outscoring women in retail, professional and business services, education and health services (traditionally a female domain), hospitality and the federal government. And when it comes to jobs lost, men have also won the jackpot, losing fewer jobs than women in utilities, information services and finance.
When Palin’s map became an issue, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, leader of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), rushed on MSNBC to denounce it, telling Chris Matthews:
The Cubs need a big change after John Hendry continuously overpaid players who were overrated to begin with, or who could only perform well for the first couple years of their contracts. The Ricketts family would be smart to hire Epstein, who would not be intimidated by a big market with fans who are dying for a World Series title. Epstein will energize fans in Chicago and won't be afraid to make the moves needed to win soon. He drafts relatively well and kept the Sox stocked with a good core of homegrown players, while still going after free agents. He won a World Series title in Boston, which no one had managed to do in 86 years, and then went out and built a team that won another one. The positives far outweigh the negatives and Epstein could really help the Cubs become a consistent contender.
It’s like anything, you get used to it. Like jumping into cool water. It’s a shock at first, but then you even things out and it feels okay. At work, they changed a site I work with a lot. When I first started using it, I found a task had become frustrating and tedious. I had to move through 500 names, 10 at a time, waiting each time for the system to bring up the next names. Doing this task, I would get bug-eyed and feel like I was falling asleep waiting for it. But after doing it a couple hundred times, I’ve gotten used to it. It no longer feels so tedious and difficult. I believe this is the process of transmutation.
But Brodsky offered his own opinion: “As of right now, I need to know more of the facts that we sought and didn't get today, and we’ll get those by the end of the year.” (Later yesterday, NY1 reported that Silver had stalled the project.)

This portfolio provides 10 instructional plans for 3rd graders based on the topic food chains. Primarily, it will focus on 3.5 of the SOL . Additionally, it will also make some connections with 3.4: animal adaptations and with 3.6: ecosystems. This project focuses on the types of relationships among living organisms and their dependence on each other for survival. The strand focuses on the life processes of plants and animals and the specific needs of each. The major topics developed in the strand include the basic needs and life processes of organisms, their physical characteristics, behavioral and physical adaptations, and survival and perpetuation of species.

On the other hand what about occasional or not intentional copies of an art work or monument, like by private family pictures in front of a painting, statue or monument. When they would have to pay for the copyrights using the painting, statue or monument in their picture this would be ridiculous. It would be even more ridiculous if the server company who allowed to have the photo or film be placed on the net would also be taken accountable for the publication and infringement of copyright laws. can yo imagine which fines and problems Facebook is going to encounter?

My evil twin brother Darth Mischievous had a monkey on his back and thought that by splitting town he could kick—HA!—and wound up couch-surfing in Chicago in the first weeks of October, freezing himself to death—anyhoot, it was a real low point in his life—and that’s when he watched Ken Russell’s The Devils on a crappy pan&scan VHS twice in a row, drinking a ton of whiskey to deal with the other pains, and he called me into the room and I got my mind blown—

Thus, the old argument that the indexicality of photography gives us a piece of the event, that it draws us physically closer to the recorded event, because literally the same light is still somehow present, is too easy for the trompe-l'œil artist. In the case of Wolfe, Oshiro, Peto and Harnett, they had no trouble working after photography. It isn’t the representation that matters but what the object and representation mean to the individual. If you believe that the human interaction with things means something, the trompe-l'œil of Oshiro and Wolfe should work for you as well.

Today started off with a nice drive through rolling hills from Minneapolis. Actually, there wasn't one hill along the way until I hit Redwood Falls. It was a nice easy drive though. The Brau Brothers had a Group Brew day which I was lucky enough to get involved with. The Brau's put on a Homebrew contest each year where they take the winners recipe and brew up on their own equipment for distribution. This year the distribution of the winning American Black Ale, (CDA, Black IPA, etc) will primarily be distributed in South Dakota, with a few select locations in the Twin Cities receiving kegs, and 750 bottles. Dustin Brau lead the show, and encouraged all 20-30 of us to dough in, stir the mash, clean the lauter tun, and basically...if you wanted to participate in the brew day, you really could. It's a fantastic idea. You can only learn basic concepts from most brewery tours, but this hands on approach really helps you understand the intricate steps within the process demystifying a typical brew day! I can't say enough about the Brau Brothers family. They are just straight up, really good, story tellin, card playin, easy going brewers, just doing a really good job brewing quality beer. They are also growing hops, barley, and rye, and I'm sure some other things. There hops are on their 4th year of growth and they clearly are doing a good job as hop farmers because their Wet Hop Ale this year was frickin fantastic. If you haven't tried their 100 Yard Dash - fresh Hop, you may still be able to find a random 6er on the shelves of your local liquor store if you're lucky. It was extremely bitter, flavorful, and a slight aroma of locally grown hops. I will say that they could've been a little more heavy handed on the hops at the end of the boil on that one. Their Ringneck Braun Ale is my favorite Brown Ale brewed in Minnesota by far.
Homeland: Now that was an episode. Okay, the one where we saw Brody in flashbacks bonding with a young boy and being conditioned to accept a political position but the one where Carrie nearly got blown to pieces was better. Carrie's becoming increasingly the best thing about this show and the closer she seems to get to a result, the more things seem to be going against her. Capturing Tom Walker in this one should've been a walk in the park but apparently not. I can't wait to see what the last two episodes are going to bring for the series.

The official date was July 24, 2011. It was a wonderful day at First Baptist Church, Shreveport, Louisiana, as the church honored us with both a retirement and birthday luncheon, along with a proclamation of Minister of Christian Formation and Administration Emeritus . And so ended 42 years of full-time ministry, serving from Georgia to Texas. Friends from several of our former churches, along with family, were present. What great fun and memories.
Then we accepted a position with Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) in Bolivia. We thought it was silly to put our stuff in storage for three years. So, we got rid of everything. This time we really did. We got rid of all our furniture, chairs, table, futon, beds, dressers…our car…everything. We still had some things stored at my mom’s but even that was picked over and cleaned out. We pared down our material possessions to an absolute minimum. It was a crazy, radical move that tested our faith and resolve to trust God and the Body of Christ.

Ever since the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments, for example, the credibility of American health care’s professionalism and ethics have been questioned. In these studies that extended between 1932 and 1972, 600 impoverished and syphilis-infected African-American men were lured by the promise of food and housing into clinical studies that tested the natural affects of syphilis on the human body (that is, without treatment), despite the fact that penicillin had already been introduced as a ground-breaking source of treatment. If not that, then maybe it was the Mississippi Appendectomies that diminished the legitimacy of America’s health care. In this exploitative clinical study, researchers and doctors unnecessarily performed hysterectomies on poor black women, thereby disabling their reproducing capabilities simply to “give young doctors a chance to practice the procedure.”
Then, it occurred to me. I remembered what don Howard had told me. In about three months, look for the changes in your life! Here I was at just that point in time and everything was being stirred up and changed in the most sensitive area of my life: my security! It was Fearful – and that made me think of what I had experienced in my first vision. Now I could compare this fear with real FEAR itself, something I had gone through and survived. Once I understood this, I felt a strange calm come over me. This new situation was not truly fearful. Not compared to the real thing! This was something in motion with a purpose and I could and would survive it and even use it! Change had been forced into action, along with me, but I had a pad of time and income to create something new!
What conclusion can any reasonable person draw from this other than that Evian and Foster's have made effective advertisements and Walkers and Cadbury's have not? Not only do Foster's make it clear that they are advertising a beer, they have made a series of different adverts using the same characters for a campaign that is still ongoing. Cadbury's, on the other hand, made one notoriously uninformative advert back in 2007 when the kids involved in this survey were 5 or 6 years old.

Now local, I phoned our tour guide arranger Mohammed, who joined us at our hotel to review the plans for the next four days.

I was looking at Roni's blog and saw that she was creating a technique journal and adding calendar pages to each month. Not having anything else to create (uh huh) I decided to follow along. Instead of using a house template I chose to use Tim Holtz' vintage valise. The pages are embellished simply since the main focus should be the technique. Sometimes my results weren't quite the same but it was fun nonetheless. I bound my journal using the Cinch.

The cordyceps grows from a spore inside the ant and turns it into a zombie. Eventually, the cordycep bursts through the ant's head or body and spreads more spores to other ants. The infected ant has the sense to get well away from the nest before its unfortunate day with the spores to minimise risk to its co-ants. It's not a pretty sight.

I'm going to start this review by saying something outrageous. Who nees family or friends, hell, who needs food when you can lock yourself in a room and immerse yourself in the wonders that are the Soul Screamers series? I'm exaggerating, of course, but that should give you some idea as to how much I really mean my love knows no bounds when it comes to this series. No review I could ever write would ever come close to expressing how much I adore this series, and specifically this book (but I'm going to try!). If I Die surpasses My Soul to Steal, and I thought that was brilliant! I'm going to say something now I never, ever thought I would say. Are you ready? Ok, here goes. I love this series more than I love the Shifters series. I know! The Shifters series was absolutely phenomenal, and I didn't think Vincent could ever write anything that came close to how amazing it is, because how can you beat perfection?! Guess what? The Soul Screamers series is better!
7. Poor bedside manner. This is an easy one and has been addressed extensively by others, but don’t do things such as repeatedly looking at the clock, repeatedly interrupting patients, focusing more on you than the patient, talking rudely, making poor eye contact, etc. Follow the Golden Rule and you will easily establish rapport the majority of the time.

The Pecs and the Back
Someone who doesn’t smoke, or drink, or use recreational drugs could turn a condescending eye on a person who can’t quit smoking or drinking or using drugs. They’d say “just don’t do that, can’t you see it’s harming you.” And then this same person might be a closet scale junkie. The same person may be battling their weight and not be able to walk past a scale without hopping on “just to see where they’re at” on any given day. And if you said to that same person “don’t do that, can’t you see what it’s doing to you”, they may laugh and say it’s no big deal, it just keeps them on track. They may not see the mental wrecking ball they are smashing into their own efforts.

Anyway today is green day, so today’s focus is about what you can start to live without and reduce resources. As times get tighter and we see the news headlines talking about more job losses, higher cost of living and the lack of mortgage lending, cutting back is on all our minds.

We went to Wendys for a Jr Bacon Cheeseburger, then to Jewelry Box, and then to Dollar Tree. Then back home. I had about 30 minutes before the bus. Kari and I got Julia's kids from the bus, and we headed to the park. Julia was at the dentist. She was done shortly. We stayed for a few more minutes, then all headed home to get our kids ready for baseball.

Iridology is generally based on the concept of neural pathways between the body and the iris. Although iridologists may differ on the exact mechanism, most maintain that the iris reflects what is happening throughout the body via nerve conduction from all parts of the body to the eye.
I know that God’s strength is greater than my weakness, which is greatly reassuring, as my weaknesses are great and many. So, I pray for the wherewithal to allow God to take charge, and to be my strength, overcoming my weaknesses; giving me the freedom and strength to prioritise God, and the courage to put my hand up and say, “Yes! I have seen God. He is in everyone.”

In ICS, Android no longer requires a separate password to protect the system credential storage. Rather, it uses the screen lock password for this purpose, and the Android Device Administration API can be used for central policy enforcement. This means, for example, that the screen lock password can’t be removed as long as the secured credentials remain on the device.

Goodie Mob performed their new single recently on The Voice. The long awaited reemergence of the legendary group is finally over. After over a decade of dis-membership they join back together to perform this interestingly unique but totally normal performance, when it comes to the Goodie Mob that is. The group known for their extravagant use of obscure and different style in clothing. Beside the perception of appearance, the song, that is sung and performed is very inspirational. Nothing less is expected of cee-lo and his cast. The album “Age Against The Machine” is expected to be released sometime later in the year.
Looking out my living room window this morning, I watch with awe at the powerful thunderstorm raging all around our home. Although it is now several hours after sunrise, darkness quickly envelopes the land as the ominous storm clouds race to block out any rays of light. As the sky lets loose all at once with a violent downpour, the room echoes with the pounding of the rain on the roof and I find it hard to see through the quickly clouding window and the steady stream of water falling to the earth. The river is now raging as strong winds whip up and cause whitecap waves to crash about while the water is simultaneously pummeled by the large, powerful raindrops exploding on its surface. A bright white flash fills the dark sky as lightning crackles through the heavens, and almost immediately, the booming clap of accompanying thunder rattles our home. The lightning is so close that the thunder clap starts with the unmistakeable snap like the crack of a whip and then explodes with the earth-shaking boom letting me know that I am in the heart of the storm.
Now, one may assume that given Dabney's background, this segment would be music-related ... but (rubs hands together in fiendish manner) we actually did something a little different. In fact we may or may not have gotten way ambitious. That's because we filmed an interview, some Oscar predictions, AND a fashion montage. That's right -- a fashion montage.
The Lord has sustained me in all sorts of situations where I consciously refrain from turning into the food for my life~all those things food can be that brink on the negativity to destroy me. FOOD MUST stay in it's rightful place in my life...and I don't tolerate it rearing up it's ugly head to try to move into more prominence. NO WAY! I refuse to allow people or events to change what's working...no tossing about like a ship tossed in a storm...I believe with God's help, I must stay firmly affixed to the task of making sure that I am nourished properly each and every time...no changes here, for me.
Some have said it is strange that I still live in the same town where I grew up. Some would also say that it is strange that I attended a university in the same city where I grew up. Some would say that it is really strange that I work at the university I attended in the city I grew up. I say that it’s just me being true to myself and having a strong sense of personal pride.

Well today, a measure of uncertainty returns with the tabling of a Bill by Fianna Fail to abolish Upward Only Rent Reviews. The Bill is called the Landlord and Tenant (Business Leases Rent Review) Bill 2012 and it should be published shortly on the Oireachtas website here. Fianna Fail deputy Dara Calleary, who introduced the Bill, sets out more information about its contents and objectives here. Fianna Fail presently has 19 deputies in the 166-member Dail though it is likely to find support from other elements of the Opposition, but ranged against a Government which holds a decisive majority with 109 even after deducting the four who have lost the whip, the Bill seems unlikely to get off the starting blocks.
No other super-book has ever caught the sense of perpetual crisis matched with the almost-psychedelic intensity of experience which characterises so much of mid-teen life. Lee and Ditko's crowded, swift-paced storytelling captures a world of almost-constant bafflement and crisis matched with occasional, and often illusionary, moments of extraordinary achievement. Those who've characterised the early Spider-Man as nothing but a costumed soap opera have confused its creator's methods with their achievement. Yes, Lee and Ditko presented their readers with a tragi-comic melodrama replete with quite-literally faint-hearted guardians and doomed-to-lose love affairs, but those plot-beats were used to create the most convincing of all superheroic depictions of two-steps-from-adulthood life. We care for this version of Peter Parker not just because he's a decent-hearted and lovable loser, but because his adolescent experiences evoke, in their own ridiculously exaggerated way, our own. His is a superhero story that's genuinely concerned with everyday life rather than the perpetuation of any mined-out, life-sidestepping fantasies.

Good news is that most of England has now been released from the drought warning. Everywhere that is except... the South East! Typical, not that we need to use hose pipes or anything at the moment... Not that I have a garden that even needs a hosepipe. It just made me chuckle.

The reality gets worse. In talking to multiple employment consultants, I was told that I should do everything possible to hide my disability from prospective employers, because I would be discriminated against. Not might, would. Nearly twenty years after the Disability Discrimination Act required employers to ensure disabled people are able to work and compete for jobs on an equal footing, with the new Equality Act making it illegal to even consider disability in a recruitment decision, people who had spent years as recruitment professionals were telling me that discrimination against disabled job applicants was so universal I needed to hide who I was in order to have any hope of making it past the first cut. One employers’ group proclaimed it a triumph for equality that slightly more than one employer in four would consider employing a disabled person. Meanwhile the other seventy-odd percent of employers surveyed openly acknowledged their intent to flout the law, confident in being able to do that because the government does not enforce disability equality law, that is left to the disabled victims themselves, who overwhelmingly have neither the health, wealth nor legal background to be able to challenge the offenders. The disablist attitudes of employers represent perhaps the single most fundamental barrier to moving large numbers of disabled people into work, and also a barrier open to being dealt with by action from central government, yet the silence from DWP, and from IDS’s ministerial team, is deafening.

Understand this folks, bring it down to your heart. How we treat others, even the least, the one you think so little of, in God’s eyes is how we treat HIM. I feel so sad for those who have despitefully used us, who have had so little good to say regarding me and schemed and gossiped, for they must answer to God. So I pray daily for them, that they may realize what they have done and repent before God, and thus be made whole. They are confident in their religiosity, their self-righteousness, yet are blind to what Jesus thinks regarding it, ignoring the truth they know for it is not convenient for them. Such is the way of self-deceit.
Here’s why I think Dad led me to think of myself as an entrepreneur — HE ALWAYS HATED THAT JOB. I’m pretty confident that he hated it for the almost 30 years. How in the hell does one do something that he hates for 30 or so years? Probably because he loves his family, see the above fed and clothed reason. However, even with my dad’s commitment to a job he hated because it had a good pension and good benefits, yada, yada – I sometimes think, Sh*t, we struggled anyway. He should’ve done something he loved.

6. I can't believe how many running events are hosted by Disney. They all sound REALLY fun and I can see why people are hooked. I am a HUGE Disney fan. I am just not sure I'd want to spend even one second of a Disney vacation getting up at 4 am to run and then be tired. It seems there are races every few weeks at one of the parts and people always seem so happy. And it seems that Disney races have turned some people into runners. A new-to-me blog especially for Disney fans is EAT, SLEEP, RUN DISNEY. I guess if you have to run long distances, having Disney characters cheer you on is the best way to do it.

I tried to distract myself by bringing back pictures of the beaches and the sea, pretending to feel the sea breeze instead of the machine's ventilator.

But forever isn't good if the publisher isn't promoting the book. Why should publishers have control over books they aren't marketing and selling? If your book is no longer available for order or download, or if its availability is limited (for instance, if there are no print copies that can be ordered by stores and the book exists only in an electronic edition), or if it's still available but few or no copies are selling, you're better off if the publisher takes it out of print, allowing you to revert the rights and regain control of them. Perhaps you can do something else with them--re-sell them, for instance (this is difficult, but not impossible), or publish through a service like the Authors Guild's Back in Print program, which allows authors to bring out-of-print books back into circulation. Even if you wind up simply holding on to the rights, it's better than letting your book languish in the publisher's vault.

Felix finds the Princess and she explains what happened: Basically, Uncle Duke was a mad scientist and in trying to build his robot army, he maimed himself and had to build himself that stunning oxrobot body. He was supes jealous of his brother, the then king and wanted all of the secrets to the kingdom, like the secret of the Dimental Poridge. But Oriana will never give them to him. NEVAR. And her daddy banned him to the land beyond the impasse. And then Uncle Duke did evil things and has now captured the princess.
Probably the best pub we found was Horse Brass a traditional english pub a short cab ride out of downtown. In addition to a great selection of local brews, this quaint timber-laden bar had a good selection of internationally acclaimed brews such as Weihenstephaner and Affligem. The passionate and knowledgable staff didnt make it hard to pursuade the uninitiated to jump from local to global. We even shouted some locals a bottle of Duchesse de Bourgogne. I am ashamed to say, the West Coast IPA had worn a little thin by now.

For the opening third of L.A. Noire, I didn't understand Phelps. I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. Normally, I play the good guy, or at least the cool anti-hero, and it took me a long time to realise that Phelps is just an arrogant prick. L.A. Noire became much more enjoyable after that. It wasn't my fault that Phelps was a human wrecking-ball; I just had to deal with it. But I was relieved when control switched to the far more agreeable Jack Kelso late in the story.

The weather this week has been drastically different to last weeks glorious sunshine. It has been cold, grey and miserable with strong winds and ground frosts, we even had some light snow and hail. I didn’t make it to the plot much this week, thankfully I’d had the foresight to cover my peas and other crops with some horticultural fleece on Monday, hopefully this will have protected them from the frost. My rhubarb was not lucky enough to escape the weather, It got battered in the wind and when we finally made it down to the plot today, two of my rhubarb plants had been damaged. Hopefully they’ll recover.

Hackins Hey, for example, was a quaint by-way in Liverpool with small shops dating from the 18th century. But to planners and councillors it was only history and so it was destroyed overtime for a railway station that was not built. What little remains of Liverpool’s unique character and community spirit is still under threat. In 2005, the government issued a directive to destroy 20,000 habitable homes in Liverpool (and thousands more elsewhere), to be replaced by largely executive-style homes beyond the economic reach of dispossessed locals. Whole Liverpool neighbourhoods are still being flattened and their often unwilling communities compulsorily dispersed.

What can make a poker web page truly make income? It is not simply in attracting clients with definitely excessive rakebacks. It is mostly within the fun on the adventure. Sure, it could be nice to have some of the cash back again but you may also think about the high quality from the games you play. There would not be any exciting in playing game titles that do provide you with higher rakebacks and other bonuses but place you to sleep anyway because another players aren’t that skillful. You can not be understanding something the following and if something, it’s detrimental to your skill mainly because you are not being challenged adequate.
When I was young, I had very fine, very curly hair. The hairdresser our family used decreed that my hair must always be short. For nearly 10 years I had exactly the same hairstyle – very short and curly. I loathed it. At fourteen, I finally put my foot down and didn’t have my hair cut for 3 years. The end result was that I had something that resembled a large, fluffy shrub on my head, g0ing upwards and outwards by the same amount. I vowed at fourteen that I would NEVER insist on a particular hairstyle for my children and that they could choose their own styles. I’ve maintained this with the older children, with the proviso that whatever style they have, they must take care of their hair (or allow us to do so). So, a haircut like Puck’s? A large gulp, followed by a “Sure thing.” Conal was very happy.

After writing about the iconic lemonade stand as a model with which to teach children about entrepreneurship, one of my readers asked if paper routes counted too. I hadn’t given that any thought, so I went to my first research stop, my friend Mr. Google. It seems that lemonade stands, paper routes, and babysitting have been recognized as the big three of early work experiences for kids, as they learn about earning money of their own. Lemonade stands have become the iconic entrepreneurial standard because they involve children embarking on their own venture, with its attendant risks and rewards, as opposed to paper routes and babysitting, where the child is learning responsibility and the value of work and reward of money, but is working for someone else.

Rapport aside, Schock has shown no obligation to spin the narrative into a puff piece. Circo celebrates the wonders of a rich tradition without shying away from the baggage that comes along with it. “The circus is beautiful and harsh,” says Tino. Vibrant colors of aerial performances and small towns in Mexico come hand in hand with the unflinching reality of the children’s lack of education and a “normal” childhood. However, it never occurred to me that Schock was passing judgment on his subjects. It is admirable for a documentary to trust its participants in telling their stories, and to trust its viewers in listening to their stories.

It was a comment that pointed out ways that 'other reproductive choices' (I'll keep it vague here) were better than adoption. Specifically, there was a point made about a partial genetic connection vs. NO genetic connection, and an adopted child having an 'other mother' vs. this blogger's child having only them as a mother. The commenter went on to say that the blogger's choice made them 'closer' than an adopted mother would be to the adopted child.

Manohara (meaning “Hart theft”) claims the Malaysian Prince kidnapped her during a pilgrimage, and for nine months abused her in all classical ways possible. Last year she managed to escape with the help of both her mother and the American embassy. When the press published the cover stories, Indonesians started protesting. In Jakarta, it was reported riots outside the Malaysian embassy. Both the Governments have withdrawn politically from the case, and stated that this is a private affair between husband and wife.

My flight to Monterey was scheduled for 8:15 yesterday morning. The night before, the weathermen were predicting storms of apocalyptic proportions. I was so looking forward to this trip. I knew that this trip was going to be really beneficial to my writing career. After spending a week with a stomach virus running rampant through my family, I needed this trip. When the newscasters said that flights out of O'Hare would likely be cancelled, I started shaking and twitching. "You don't understand! I HAVE to go!"
The fact that all of the migrants on board are men tells us that this is most likely a ploy to game the refugee system to get family and friends into the country. The successful asylum claim opens the door to seemingly endless chain migration where whole families have been transported to Canada out of one immigration application. The problem with this is that these immigrants do not need any pertinent job skills or language skills to immigrate to Canada. It is likely the 76 men on the Ocean Laddy do not have either as well.

Background fabric should be a white-on-white (WOW) quilting cotton. If you make multiple blocks–as usual, you can enter up to 9 blocks–you may use the same WOW for all your blocks. For each block, you'll start with a 7-to-10 inch square.

Full disclosure -- I have never met Dr. Chang, and have seen none of his videos. But I do know something about his subject in these quotes. As I see it, there are three options -- Dr. Chang is very ignorant of China's international adoption program, he is intentionally lying to adoptive families, or he is not understanding what is being asked.

Bieber, 17, who was discovered on video-sharing site Youtube in 2008 is known for his high-pitched voice, which betrayed his true age. His songs receive extensive airplay and earning him extraordinary exposure, mostly due to his child-like voice.
I have learned much this year. I learned the importance of importance. If there is nothing of importance in your life, you have to find something and make it important. I learned the importance of goals, even if it’s only the goal of getting through one more day. I learned the importance of hope, though hope for what I still don’t know, but that is part of the journey – building hopes, creating dreams, finding reasons to live.
If you gain an extra $100 a week, and then work to find out how you can keep the extra money and continue to make it every week, you have changed your comfort zone.

And it’s OK to do nice things for myself. I get massages a couple of times a month. I get my nails done weekly. I make time for the occasional pedicure. I connect with my friends, who are scattered geographically, more often than before. And I ask for their help.
You get up this morning, you don’t feel well. Money is tight, you haven’t slept well for several nights, your boss has been very demanding lately and your dog is sick. So, you snap at your husband. Your husband is now grouchy and he goes to work and snaps at his secretary. She goes to lunch and is in such a bad mood she doesn’t leave the waitress a tip. The waitress is depending on her tips just to make her car payment. The waitress is unable to make her car payment, her car is repossessed, so now she has no transportation for work. Since his main waitress can’t get to work, the restaurant owner loses business and ends up shutting down the diner.

My personal religious experience: The Lord Jesus is my savior, my shepherd, my teacher, my brother, and my friend. Apart from Him I am nothing and can do nothing. He rescued me from the pit of destruction many years ago. Without Him I would be dead, gone, and forgotten. He gave me back my self, my soul, and my dreams. Through the Holy Spirit, He gives me the strength and the purpose to carry on day after day.

When MTV hires the producers for the show, they make sure that their employees are young and can build relationships and “fit in” with the people they are filming, to help keep the footage as raw as possible. They don’t want the individuals on the show to act as though they are being filmed in front of some old producer who doesn’t really understand what they are going through. They also need to be able to work ridiculous hours, since life doesn’t stop when the cameras turn off. The producers explain how they had to sleep on floors and in their cars just in case something happened that they needed to film. The producers also need to be brave, as certain stories take place in very dangerous places, such as Iraq or the projects.

It's also not like Brad Pitt wasn't in Thelma And Louise, either. He's just limited by his part to be a tough guy, say tough guy things, set his jaw square and firm and interject the word "doodle" into every other sentence. Aside from a look here and a emotive fit there, nothing special....
What people fail to realize sometimes is that your body shape doesn’t necessarily correlate with your weight. Just because two people are the same size, does not mean that the same bathing suit will fit their body the same. One can be a size 4 with a square-shaped body, while the other is also a size 4 with a triangle-shaped body. Since their body shapes are different, the bathing suits that fit them the best will also differ. Follow these simple tips, and you’ll surely sizzle in your bathing suit as you enjoy the Summer sun!
I enjoy all things outdoors. Camping and fishing are two of my faves. I also enjoy reading, it allows me a little time in another world "away from it all". I love making matching dresses for me and my daughters. I am trying right now to take my sewing skills to a new level by trying my hand at making some fitted diapers for the Velociraptor. I enjoy listening to music, I have tons that I love and only a select few that I don't. I'm not big on wearing make up though I will for certain events and I own dress clothes and heels but am more comfortable in jeans, a cute top and some tennis shoes. I am pretty easy going and can be very spontanious at times, though being a Mommy has given me alot more responsiblities and spontanaiety and parenting does not fit all the time!
While I certainly will be adjusting to a lifestyle quite unlike the Irish one I am so accustomed to, France will be a welcome change. It is undoubtedly a country with a past. Centuries of bloodstained history define my future home: tales of beheaded Kings and battles to the death, tested rivalries and colossal challenges to the defence of the country’s borders from seemingly unconquerable foreign armies echo throughout the ages.
Actually, most reputable publishing companies complete books in less time than 90 days. According to your former staff, you never read the books. How many of your authors have received repeated galleys that were incorrect time after time? Plenty of them. I’ve had authors tell me that they just signed the galleys after three and four rounds because they needed to get their books out. I’m not sure which company you are referring to that has one new client per month, but that’s typical of not knowing what you are referring to in most of your attacks.

Since I won't be attending The International Quilt Market this spring in Salt Lake City, my younger daughter, Katie and I visited Moda in Dallas, Texas. What a wonderful trip we had! I thought you might enjoy seeing some of the Moda facilities and where all of the "Magic" happens. It really is impressive! It was a very quick trip but we really enjoyed it.

One July afternoon while we were out for a smoke on the steps, Kevin pointed out a mural of Harvey Milk I hadn’t noticed before, though it was directly across the street from our office. The portrait (by Josef Norris, 1998) is partially shadowed by a luscious tree. It is as though Harvey is looking down on the shop, bemused, checking in on business. The mural also includes Milk’s message, You’ve gotta give ‘em hope! “That was Harvey’s camera shop right down there,” Kevin told me, pointing to the storefront below. Less than a week later I finished reading the biography of Harvey Milk in tears on the 22.

I'm not much of a glitter person, but I've always been fascinated with the way that German glass glitter looks. Traditionally it only came in silver or gold but in the last couple of years its been made in more colors. This put me in a bit of a quandary, since I could never make up my mind as to which color I wanted. And then I had a eureka moment: I didn't need to buy it in a bunch of different colors, I could make it in any color I wanted with my copic re-inkers.

Never in a million light years would I would have guessed that I would have found such tremendous friends....and you know who you are. These girls would take a bullet for me and I'd take one for them. They truly are my soul-sisters and I adore them. That being said, we talk/write each and every day. Often several times a day depending on how much we are procrastinating our work. So I feel very much a part of the blog world....the world is just much smaller. And that was what I was looking for: a support group and I was lucky to find this awesome group.
But for a few months, I had no bars, no reception. Incoming calls were routed directly to voicemail, or sometimes, lost altogether. Text messages failed. This is not good. If I go incommunicado, I want it to be on my own terms.

One of the reasons I love this recipe is because I don't have to deal with the frying pan. I always get nervous when I fry things because of all the oil that bubbles and pops; not to mention the stench it leaves in the house and in my hair and clothes. These baked up nicely in the oven without me having to worry about them. I'll definitely be making these again and again.

Now, for your question. See, I’d be all for installing my own people to run puppet governments for me, and saving all the trouble that comes with giving the different city leaders the leeway to do things their way, but if you don’t do it right it’s more headaches than it’s worth. Biggest problem is it’s AWFULLY hard to keep control of a captive population if the people weren’t on board with the regime change.

Let's assume Glass Pops were a real product, this was a real commercial, and there were people out there buying and eating delicious Glass Pops. What, then, is the problem that Truth has with this commercial. This guy comes on and gives you real information about the dangers of their product, information that you can use to determine whether or not the risk is worth it to you to consume it. He's using no trickery, no hyped statistics, no manipulative imagery or spokesmen. He's standing in front of millions and urging everyone to get the facts and use personal responsibility before engaging in risky behavior.

With tears in his eyes, he was twelve at the time, he had done just that, and her being too young to understand what was going on just went on by her brothers side, no sandals, just feet in the earth. They walked for a while before night time came and her brother finally tried to explain to her young mind that they would never see their parents again. This did not sit well with this Irish lass, she started wailing for her parents and wanted to go back home, but her brother would not let her. She fought him, young fists pounding on his almost adolescent chest, made to grow up too fast, but by jolly he held on to her. He had to, he eyes were blood shot, his cheeks were tear stained but he held on to her. He knew that he was now in charge of this little angel, he called her that, his little angel. That night she fell asleep in his arms, mid sob. He could not sleep, he tried to picture the future, all he saw was darkness. The stars were not shining that night.
I don't claim to have the answers to what you choose to appreciate or how to get to a place that feels better than this. I only know that I don't want to get "sucked in" to the drama of what feels like endless debates in politics and on the news. So I'm turning the channel again! Besides, I can't escape "the news." I hear it from people around me, when I sign onto the internet, from Facebook and Twitter notifications and I don't live in a cave! But I do choose not to internalize all of this: this is an opportunity for me to know what I really want for me, my life, my community, my country and my world.

A burrito bowl without cheese (add extra guacamole instead as a healthier fat option) is a good choice. Look for healthful options that are popping up on menus nationwide. They include things like chili-lime salmon burritos with a whole wheat tortilla, blackened/grilled mahi burritos wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and Health Mex bowls without rice (get cabbage instead; if you get a burrito with rice, unwrap it and don’t eat the tortilla but eat the rice). Corn tortillas are better than flour tortillas, and guacamole is a better choice than cheese. If you have a taste for Tex-Mex, fajitas are always a healthy option – choose salmon or chicken, load up on the veggies and a side salad and eat only one of the flour tortillas. A side of black beans is a better carbohydrate choice that will keep you full for hours.
Years ago when women learned that their babies would not live long after birth, they were strongly encouraged not to bond with the baby. If you weren’t attached to something, you wouldn’t have to waste time grieving over it, and you could just get back to life after all was said and done. I’m not sure how someone could possibly have imagined that this was a good idea nor can I imagine being forced to deal with the loss of an infant in such a way.

(Author's note: What the Hell is this shit you may be asking. Well in the last six months I have seen two "non-fiction documentaries" on how the United States government and the rest of the world in general would respond to an alien invasion. Both shows had some serious real scientific talent speaking about how we could defeat a far more advance technological species trying to take our planet. One show was on the Discovery Channel and the other was on National Geographic. I have included You Tube videos to both shows so nobody will think I have gone completely off the deep end. This story is a prequel to a similar one I did for Friday Flash Fiction several months ago. On a deeper level I wrote this story just because I was stuck at the house and freaking bored out of my mind. Leave comments if you make it to the end of this incredibly ridiculous story.)

In 2011, the statistics show that 87% of the NYPD’s almost 700,000 stop-and-frisks involved Black and Latino persons; only 12% of those stops resulted in arrests, and less than 1% of those stops resulted in an arrest for weapon possession or an otherwise violent crime. Council Member Letitia James has joined many of her colleagues in criticizing the stop-and-frisk policy as one that forges distrust between the department and minority communities.

What Gussie lacks in athletic prowess, he more than triple his cuddliness. He likes nothing better than to curl up on the bed, lying next to me. The doggy version of spooning. The only soft puppy fur left on him is on top of his head, between his ears. That is where I snuggle with him and he will lay there till the next medic one siren blares through the hood. Gussie will then bound (yes, and trip) off the bed, run through the dog door to sound the woo-woo alert. Thank you Gus, we wouldn’t want to miss a single medic one run, even at 3 in the morning.

“More than 50 percent of such attacks target organizations with fewer than 2,500 employees, and almost 18 percent target companies with fewer than 250 employees,” the report read. “These organizations may be targeted because they are in the supply chain or partner ecosystem of a larger company and because they are less well-defended. Furthermore, 58 percent of attacks target non-execs, employees in roles such as human resources, public relations, and sales. Individuals in these jobs may not have direct access to information, but they can serve as a direct link into the company. They are also easy for attackers to identify online and are used to getting proactive inquiries and attachments from unknown sources.”

At this point I could go round digging for statistics about how many murders there are in the US, but I'd have more success walking out into the main road and trying to stop speeding lorries with my penis than I would trying to argue with this guy. It would probably be less painful, too. I'm not sure he even understands what the word 'deterrent' means. If he does, he's hiding it deep under layers of his own bluster here.
As I said, Ram Gopal Varma has usually shown that he loves his characters, perhaps Nishabd is a shining example of that. Perhaps he loves those ones more who do smile but aren’t really happy deep inside. Inside they are lonely, they are afraid and they just hope that things will be fine, and they don’t. Nothing really will happen until there is a diametric change and that does happen, and to let it happen they don’t stop or run away but keep on going, until they realize that stupidity has happened and it is too late.

Another reason I didn’t put up the estimate progress for TSR, is the change of thought I don’t find that I should anyway now. It would certainly be without any problems as long as progress goes on steadily, but then what if it doesn’t? What if the staff needs to take a break or something and it doesn’t move for a while? I think it’ll kind of create the negative effect on the public when the numbers doesn’t move for some time, which might cause a negative effect on the staff as well. Editing progress on TSR is not really constant and fixed due to it being a side project and the extensive changing on text, so it’ll probably be best to just keep it this way.

Income Tax Surcharge – one of the smaller lessons learned from the health care reform debate is the sheer amount of of money that can be raised from a surcharge on the richest Americans. In the House’s bill, one of the ways that the bill is paid for is a surcharge of “1 percent of income between $280,000 and $400,000; 1.5 percent of income between $400,000 and $800,000; and 5.4 percent of income in excess of $800,000″ for individuals and “1 percent of income between $350,000 and $500,000; 1.5 percent of income between $500,000 and $1 million; and 5.4 percent of income in excess of $1 million” for couples filing jointly. Keep in mind that we’re talking about only 1.2% of American taxpayers, and an average rate increase of about 3%. And yet, this surcharge will likely generate $55 billion a year.

These beads in the top picture were all made with various Double Helix glass and 24Karat gold leaf.

They may have been fashionable glamorous people, but their work focused on the life of the mind. Through their correspondence, parties and meetings they rebranded the idea of sociability to embrace women's right to education and enlarged the boundaries of what women could think, write, and do. And thus the term ‘Bluestocking’ came to refer to the informal quality of the gatherings and the emphasis on conversation over fashion.
But where does the openness end

The Guardians also have counterparts, known as the “Fallen”, who possess the same powers as the Guardians but use it for cross purposes. Jeremy and Julian find this out when they encounter the leader of this faction, a smooth-talking but sinister character by the name of Damion, and only escape with the help of the Guardians. However, they are then pursued by Damion’s minions, zombie-like characters called “autonoids”, who are trying to get at Jeremy through Julian.
Hi, readers! As you know, the Philippine Blog Awards event is already over, but I want to tell you about my speech. It’s not very long, but I think it will do. I didn’t win any award, and I didn’t have a chance to speak . But here it is, anyway.↓
This our most favorite night.... See you all then!!!! Carol
For what that's worth.
David Buck – The Dead Drummer (Adapted by Haydn Middleton from an original radio script.)
So, we left at 11:00 and drove down to the Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh by 12:30. We were seated at two adjacent tables and enjoyed a great lunch of German fare, with some great beer to boot (well, no one got a boot glass, but that's another story). After lunch, we met with Ed, the head brewer, Eckhard, the brewmaster, and Tom, the general manager. They gave us an informal presentation on the store, the brewing, etc. After which, we got a small brewhouse tour. Interestingly, all the beer is brewed on site here - except for the Maibock (now on tap) and the Oktoberfest. Both, because of licensing issues, must be imported from Germany.

There needs to be a change in the zeitgeist for the greater community of California and patients all across the US – to speak out against the ultimate injustice of the discrimination which medical cannabis user’s face – and finally get rid of the incompetence. Meanwhile, California can only keep on dreaming…

Cut the politically correct tape tying everyone's hands and do something about this Terrorist group who hate everything our great county stands for.
Of course this led to a long discussion in which evil bro and I expressed things we weren't agreeing on. There were many. To my surprise, we ended up having more in common than I thought
Why can black Africans run, jump and throw better than honkies, but why, out of a billion of them, have they never invented a single thing of any worth? Why have they, collectively, contributed absolutely nothing to the advancement of humanity.
It has taken me 10 hard years to carve out a moment of time just for me. 3,650 days of wiping four children’s derrieres, shopping and preparing food for grubby little hands whose basic instinct is not to say thank you when something is handed to them but, rather, give me MORE, thereby forcing me to spend countless hours teaching manners and respect and what it means to be a decent human in this world, only to start the whole process all over again the next morning because nobody remembered what happened the day before.
Now, I am not saying that doing everything God’s Word commands will always bring immediate ease and comfort in life, but In this instance it calmed the beast. The one in me and the one in the other person.
This also explained the pile up of vehicles we saw at the Canada side of the border crossing - law enforcement officials were searching every vehicle looking for the escaped prisoners.
Hmm, and there was I hoping that it might be something like the scene in one of the Wodehouse novels where an incompetent minstrel band has one of its members declaring, 'ha, ha I finished first'.
Chris initially thought it was too small, but most pendants are pretty small. We got the 12 inch one instead of the 8 inch one. What do you think? Do you like the new look of it? It's much better than the gaping hole or rusted goldish thing that was there before, that's for sure!

CUD: Was Carl's voice up for it? Would new guitarist Felix fill the considerable boots (Hey Boots!) of the assistant headteacher from Tadcaster? Would the band gel like the greasiest Ted? Yes, yes and yes! Carl bellowed like a moose, holding a note like Pavarotti. Felix is the indie Jimi Hendrix and the band were tighter than a gnat's chuff.
This year, Cameron and I will be by ourselves for Easter and so our plans are fairly simple--we're planning on going to church and then going out for brunch here. (I'm already counting down the minutes until Sunday when I will no doubt be in food coma heaven!) It will definitely be different than last year when we hosted some out of town friends for Easter, but I'm actually looking forward to having a low-key celebration and letting someone else cook and clean up! So even though I won't be baking and crafting this year, I thought I'd share some of my favorite springtime pins for those of you in need of ideas! Enjoy!

Thank you for listening, and good night.
Sigur Rós, let me be honest with you: I had barely heard of them. But that is where it becomes fun to be confronted by a young redactional team. From time to time they have persuasive arguments to change even the mind of a somewhat elderly chief-editor. Such as: Sigur Rós was top of the bill at Werchter and Pukkelpop. and moreover: de Morgen Magazine is the only one, worldwide, to do an interview with the musical sensation of 2008. And if that wasn't enough persuasive force: Belgian photographer Eva Vermandel made a photoalbum about this band. Sometimes even the most obtuse chief-editor can be moved by such arguments. So, we want to know. who are these people out of bankrupt Iceland that can inspire the young folks in Flanders so much that they even achieve the top while singing in a non-existing language? Further more there is the remarkable role played by Flemish photographer Eva Vermandel in the Sigur Rós saga. She made a remarkable photoalbum about the band which was added to the luxurious edition of the latest album by the band. When she was 22 she left for London in the hope of building up a career as photographer there. aAtask she managed quite well. Without much glamourous tricks she made photographs for the Observer, the Independent magazine and worked for the Wire and British Vogue. that deserves some respect. As much respect goes to Sigur Rós, the counterpoint to the adage which tells us that the media is all-defining. Sigur Rós never needed the media, they even didn't want anything to do with it. Thus they haven't done any interviews this year, with the exception for one in the British magazine Q. How then did Bart Steenhaut managed to get to them? Shall we ever get an answer to it? Two years ago there was an appointment, but then front-man Jónsi left without honouring it. Now however it worked. Flemish Eva Vermandel probably provided a link. Because things work out between Vermandel and the Icelandic sensation. "I thought what she does is real art. not too styled, not too cool" we are told. Maybe the most interesting question of them all was asked at the end of the interview, especially so after the impressive performance Sigur Rós pulled off at Vorst Nationaal. With what sort of feeling do you hope the crowd leaves after a Sigur Rós concert Bart Steenhaut wanted to know. "I hope they are happy and satisfied. but above all I hope our music inspires. Sometimes i am amazed when i see the part our music plays in the lives of others."
FORCE begins well; in fact the opening shot of John Abraham clutching at a rock face reminds one of a similar shot in CLIFFHANGER. However the biggest letdown is John himself, for despite his six pack structure and handsome looks, he just does not emote. True, the character he plays is that of a tough cop who is emotionless, but even such a character needs to be emoted!! Surprisingly, the best performance comes from debutant Vidyut Jamwal in the role of the cold and ruthless villain; he certainly will win the best villain award for this year. Genelia is forever playing the effervescent bubbly genial girl and so perhaps script writers pen their scripts keeping this in mind; even her open expression of her desire in the movie to make love to the cop sounds childlike rather than adult.
I have been looking through a dirty window for several weeks and I couldn't take it any longer. The ladder I was needing to clean the window was over at our shop and I didn't want to drive 5 miles to get it for a 2 minute job. Call me lazy I guess, but I just wanted the window cleaned RIGHT NOW!!!! So I did what any farm girl does and "farmer rigged" some concoction up to get my windows clean.
Let’s now take a look at the boat. It was large, having the furnishings for 276 passengers made up of soldiers, sailors and prisoners along with a few (at least two) passengers. We know from the context that Luke and Aristarchus accompanied Paul on the trip.

This is quite a handsome and functional case. I paid only $25 for it new through a seller on Amazon, which I consider to be quite a deal, but I typically see it listed for $35-$40. Amazon had one of these left in "red" (burgundy), one in silver, a single-pen version and a 3-pen version. (It appears the 3-pen version only has loops inside, rather than sleeves.) Try this Google search, and you'll find eBay listings, too. Or, you could just go with Cross's current line-up, in which the cases are not quite as sleek as this one but still feature the holes (I know there's got to be a better name for that race-car leather look) and an easier closing mechanism than most other cases (magnetic flap rather than a tuck-in flap).

Natalie takes a walk, and decides to stop by the school library to research more urban legends, and literally bumps into Sasha, who decided to grab a copy of the Kamasutra. Together, they start reading through the urban legends book and find several familiar stories: there's the story of the person who came home late at night, unaware that there was a killer in the house murdering family members in the dark; the legend that was recreated for Damon's murder; the legend of the gang member deciding to kill the teenagers who flashed their headlights at him...you get the idea.

With this wonderful discovery, I'm eating peanut butter everyday. Yep. It's the one food I do not get tired of. Some days I eat it for breakfast and lunch, other days, just lunch.
Unlike Christmas, I don't have an issue as such with the celebration. If, like me, you don't celebrate it, no-one will make a big deal out of it. Compare that with what happens when you decide not to celebrate Christmas... Not celebrating Christmas means you're a miserable prick, not celebrating Easter isn't a big deal.
David Wilcock was visiting Kerry Cassidy at her small beach cottage in Malibu when a unit of apparent elite paratroopers landed on the beach and lay siege on her home. Before they could hit her and David (it’s not certain which one was the target, or both), Olein, transporting Lt. Cmdr. Aaron McCullum in her beamship, arrived and took out the unit.

As of the 21st, 8805 people are confirmed dead and 12,664 people are still missing. Seeing many people look for their missing family members is heart breaking. It is said that it could take up to 5 years to rebuild from the disastrous earthquake and tsunami.

Needless to say, now that I have moved so far from home, the combination of these two things makes it very difficult to recreate the food from my childhood. I oftentimes will call her up to ask her how to make something and I get a list of ingredients (without amounts), vague directions, and no cooking times. So, I am basically left on my own to make the recipe over and over again until I finally get it to turn out the way I remember it. Luckily, I consider this a labor of love.
As the night fell on the camp, we munched on our dinner: Turkey sandwiches and sticks of jerky. Ruel and Veronica started the fire and we roasted the kettle popcorn, sitting out on the wooden planks and listening to a wide variety of animals that lit up the night with calls, shrieks, and whistles. Sitting along the remarkably still water we heard voices in the distance approaching our camp, and before feeling like some ranger was on their way to put out our fire, a couple in their dual kayak, fresh from having accidently fallen in the water, pulled out of the darkness and stumbled upon our site. The more, the merrier, so we helped them set up their tent and sat up into the late hours sharing stories and trail mix on the dock before crawling back into our campsite and drifting off to sleep as the rain once again began to pour.

To start with, the ward is fantastic! Hugely overwhelming because there are a million people with new ones every week, but the young moms in particular have been so welcoming to me which really means a lot. I had a calling within a month of being here. I feel pretty well integrated already with obviously much more getting to know people to come.
Union workers, watching other job sites in Brooklyn and New York operated by non-union labor, have a legitimate sense of grievance; Forest City Ratner’s pledge to use unions--though not necessarily in its pre-construction demolition phase--has earned it continuing support.
How do you STAND that shit?
A couple of weeks ago, locking up late at night, I saw a stoat by moonlight, out at the back in the walled garden. He was wearing his winter coat, which is why I saw him, it almost gleamed in the clear night, and took me quite by surprise. I told the boys in the morning, but I think they thought I'd dreamt it, until, a few days later Rick spotted him and grabbed the camera (usual garden detritus, it's winter, I'll sort it in spring); listen to Rick's awe, he was completely alone:
During the Tohoku Celebration of Hope March 2-4, the BGEA team got to know and love members of the Samaritan’s Purse Japan staff who have been working in the Sendai area for most of the last year.
Rather than join in the gluttony (well, rather than join in it right _then_), I drove up to the Rim country yesterday--about 90 miles north of Phoenix, 50 south of Flagstaff. That's where the Pinon (there's a tilde over the first "n" in Pinon, btw, but I haven't figured out how to insert one and am too lazy to go find out)/Juniper woodland begins, and thus the closest place in which to cut greenery for the family Advent wreath.
It was estimated by many there, and from 'known' donations that around £1500 was 'in the hat', including £500 from the host, and several £100 and £50 donations from working members.
Then I raised the whip higher and brought it down harder, and she exhaled in a series of sharp pants.

We probably spent about five hours there, which was plenty. I don't feel like we missed anything.

Referring to the statement of prosecution witnesses and check-in registers, the Judge ruled these “leave no manner of doubt that visits of Kamaljit Singh to Chandigarh and his short stays, after coming late evening and leaving by next day, could not possibly be in connection with any business activity and rather were with the sole object of meeting Harpreet Kaur…”.

Kinda an icebox cake, because this time I made my own wafer cookies, so I DID need to turn the oven on. But I usually make it with the wafers from cream filled cookies (Trader Joe Joe Joe’s are my favs). I scoop out the creme and save it for……..peppermint patties!! That’s right, nothing around here goes to waste….;) This cake couldn’t get any easier!
As the country considers the new health care reform proposals and opponents speak about rationing to save money and “death panels”, remember that some of the reductions proposed are designed to spare us excessive and unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure.
- The letter ñ (n with a tilda/squiggle on top, said ¨enyay¨ in the alphabet), sounds like ¨ny¨when it´s in a word. Therefore Puno (a city in Peru) is pronounced ¨pu-no¨, but puño (a fist) is pronounced ¨poon-yo¨ (which is why baño is pronounced ¨banyo¨ rather than ¨ba-no¨).
If you will notice Paul’s concern was at least in part for the man to be delivered from this grievous sin. He was also very concerned with what it was doing and would continue doing if the rebelliousness and evil were not dealt with.

David Gelernter has a useful introduction to Disraeli's thought. I quote below what I see as Gelernter's central insight:
Stephen made an astounding statement in Acts 7:48.
I prefer the curl up variation over the more popular russian twists pictured below. In my opinion putting someone into flexion and then rotation is asking for disc issue down the road especially since most people can’t avoid excessive lumbar flexion at the top of this position.

When I became an adult and realized I’d never be cool anyway, I hit the “seek” button on my car radio and came across a song about how the good stuff in life is all the memories you build with those you love. And as I drove along the highway, tears streaming down my cheeks, I knew I had found the music of my heart. I may have grown up attending the ballet, but I’m really a redneck woman who loves country.
The final decision that the two main parties should share control of the ministry of home affairs, and that the rest of the power-sharing deal should stand as agreed by Mbeki, is neither rational nor workable.
that's the ticket...
No he was not ‘introduced’ he was seen. His void powers are inexplicable. His presence is unexplained. He’s conveniently able to prevent Shu from rescuing Inori right at the last minute for reasons of artificially furthering this plotline. And just as he’s about to kill Shu, Gai steps in and takes the blow! Gai liked Shu all along instead of being disgusted by his spinelessness causing the deaths of others! Wow this is stupid! Gai is dying in Shu’s arms and Inori has been ~magically~ kidnapped! All by a fucking deus ex machina!
There are so many poems, plays and novels whose themes are the fleeting nature of youth, beauty or life itself. But not much creative literature about the permanence of art or music or literature itself. And even less about how they struck their first viewers, listeners or readers. I wanted to examine what it would have been like to see David for the first time – or even while it was being made.
This card is more of a Congratulations card as you can see! I thought it was perfect for someone who has just received a promotion or is going off to the big city - something like that!

‘At the century-old Beehive Inn situated in Gawthorpe the following incident took place one day in 1963. Reggie Sedgewick and one Amos Clapham, a local coal merchant and current president of the Maypole Committee were enjoying some well-earned liquid refreshment whilst stood at the bar lost in their own thoughts. When in bursts one Lewis Hartley in a somewhat exuberant mood. On seeing the other two he said to Reggie, ” Ba gum lad tha’ looks buggered !” slapping Reggie heartily on the back. Whether because of the force of the blow or because of the words that accompanied it, Reggie was just a little put out.‘’ Ah’m as fit as thee’’ he told Lewis, ‘’an’ if tha’ dun’t believe me gerra a bagga coil on thi back an ‘ah’ll get one on mine an ‘ah’ll race thee to t’ top o’ t’ wood !’’ ( Coil, let me explain is Yorkshire speak for coal ). While Lewis digested the implications of this challenge a Mr. Fred Hirst, Secretary of the Gawthorpe Maypole Committee ( and not a man to let a good idea go to waste) raised a cautioning hand. ” ‘Owd on a minute,’’ said Fred and there was something in his voice that made them all listen. ‘Aven’t we been looking fer some’at to do on Easter Monday? If we’re gonna ‘ave a race let’s ‘ave it then. Let’s ‘ave a coil race from Barracks t’ Maypole.’’( The Barracks being the more common name given by the locals to The Royal Oak Public House )
Another girl (Now at the bourjois counter) excited because she could meet her boyfriend early that day.

So there, that's me in a nutshell. My choice is based on what I've worn the most and what is quintessentially me. Quite a lot of my handmade garments all work with each other but I like the fact that there are a few wild cards in my wardrobe (not many though!). I don't think you need to be Einstein to work out the patterns that appear in my handmade clothes, do you?!
A New Creation Week
Nah, maybe it was the lack of any kind of public presence in the community and the fact that a majority of the clientele were just really crappy human beings. I mean the kind of people who would say things like they would pick their dog over their unborn child and that a good punch to the gut was all she needed to make him happy.
I wish there was some way to put LIFE on hold and just rest and let my body heal. It's hard though because I get really tired of laying around. And quite frankly there are things to be done!
I hate that term – midlife crisis. It infers a kind of temporary insanity that compels rational adults to engage in wildly irresponsible or out-of-character behavior in an attempt to reconnect with their youth. You know, like acquiring racy sports cars, wearing polyester or having hot pink feathers professionally installed in one’s hair.
She caused a fuss, and threatened to become a worse thorn in their sides than Biermann had ever been. By that time she was a well known performer, and the government kicked her out with, one suspects, a sigh of relief.
Then my grandmother goes and dies! Not that I didn’t see this coming. I said my goodbyes to her knowing full well that she wouldn’t last much longer but if she was going to go three weeks after I left, couldn’t she have done so while I was there and while I could make it to the funeral and see all of my family? Being in Korea means missing another big family event and I haven’t even had time to mourn properly.
If you're going out to a really nice place, please remember that the more you pay, the less you will be consuming. Our dinner that night was comparable to what I used to feed my hamster, only slathered in butter sauce, topped with little bits of visible fat and something called emulsion whose contents were both mysterious and frightening. It was delicious and completely unsatisfying, and I think I ate desert in one giant mouthful and washed it down with a basket of bread.

Below is a letter that I sent out to students on Tuesday:
To extend more fully - films may contain politics subject to interpretation. For instance, we can state without controversy that The Birth of a Nation is a racist film. But these are not necessarily the first nor final word on the politics of those films; in any event they are never, ever the only word. This is why we can have something like DJ Spooky's Rebirth of a Nation - which I haven't seen, admittedly, but which by all accounts seems to be exemplify in its production/distribution exactly what is overlooked in the spectatorial theories of the previous paragraph: i.e., the act of reception (which entails the possibility of critique and the inevitable context of the social body). And it is around the act of reception that the more cultivated tastes of more cultivated observers may, in fact, veil a profound insensitivity to sentiment. More on this to follow.
We also stopped by Fran’s Chocolates and I bought the most outrageously delicious chocolate covered macadamia nuts. They don’t seem to be on the site but they were covered with dark chocolate and some kind of spicy crunchy coating.
Watching the young procession of mourners, as they stood in the salty spray beside the sea, I imaged myself from a distance, beside them, tossing roses for all our family members that have passed on.
I'm writing this because I feel unsettled. Everything changes to some degree when you have children, a family, people in your life whom you care for deeply. There were years in my early twenties when the thought of being a killer's next victim would have been a welcome relief - an end to the useless existence I was living. I'm sure people cared for me just as much as they do now, but I didn't care at all.
People tell me their mother’s survival story, family gossip, health issues, dreams of visiting Canada, lamentations of family immigrating to Australia, how expensive Singapore is, what the government can do to fix everything, how they wish it would be a different government….

James D. Savage and Herman M. Schwartz, “Cutback Budgeting,” Handbook of Government Budgeting. Roy T. Meyers, ed. (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1999).
The work of the Light has brought you to the moment when a great prosperity is to sweep through your societies. This prosperity heralds a series of governmental changes which will enact, among many things, the legal basis of your freedom and individual sovereignty, accompanied by an official proclamation of this. It is a historic moment. For the first time since you were permitted to enter limited consciousness, you are to be acknowledged as worthy Beings by your former ‘masters.’ At a stroke you become their equal, able to wield justice and appropriate retribution for their crimes against you and your ancestors. This time is when the present reality collapses and is transformed into a vehicle capable of conveying you back to the very threshold of full consciousness. Our responsibility is to take you from that doorway through to your final transformation, which will allow you to take your place once again among your many spiritual and space families. This will be a moment of long-awaited celebration for us all!

“We don’t have any clue about the vehicle that hit him at the junction in front of the petrol station. But we got some fragments of a broken number plate of the vehicle, which we sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) at Madiwala. Experts are trying to find the origin of the number plate,” said a police officer.
"Schools assume that children are not interested in learning and are not much good at it, that they will not learn unless made to, that they cannot learn unless shown how, and that the way to make them learn is to divide up the prescribed material into a sequence of tiny tasks to be mastered one at a time, each with its appropriate 'morsel' and 'shock'. And when this method doesn't work, the schools assume there is something wrong with the children - something they must try to diagnose and treat."
This blog. The process of writing about our experience here makes it less surreal, and people's comments, as I mentioned before, are part of what keeps my head above water.

For the first time in at least a year, Jenn and I were able to go to the farmer’s market at St. Phillips. Thats the same farmer’s market that I went to a few weeks ago and left after five minutes because I am boring. It was a heck of a lot more fun with Jenn. The market has nearly doubled in size since we first heard about it 3 years ago, I find that awesome. There are not only a lot more vendors there, but now they are selling more than just lettuce and honey. There is all kinds of grass-fed beef, mesquite flour, gluten free tasties, even somebody selling sprouted seeds. Someone flies up to Alaska every fall and catches a ton of salmon, then freezes them and flies home and sells them. Its great to see so many different kinds of locally raised and organic options available.
I love it, love it, love it.

Addle Quest: Galactrix
In the chapter “Voltaire's Coconuts” in Ian Buruma's Anglomania (that title is used for the whole book in a UK edition; the proposal in the entry on Government is that one should try the English form, with its guaranteed liberties, everywhere, just as one should at least try to grow coconuts, native to India, in Bosnia and Serbia), the author relates that Voltaire tried to grow pineapples at Ferney. In the Philosophical Dictionary (that Wikipedia article badly needs some editing), s.v. Loix (Laws), Voltaire tells a story of some Jews of the time of Vespasian stranded on the island of Padrabranca in the Maldives (Pedra Branca is actually near Singapore). “… on y trouve les plus gros cocos & les meilleurs ananas du monde” 'there one finds the largest coconuts and the best pineapples in the world'. (Of course Voltaire probably knew that pineapples wouldn't have grown there back then. The story revolves around the refusal of a pious Essene to marry what might be the last Jewish women to preserve the race, on account of Mosaic Law; when the castaways move to a nearby populated island, where the law says that all strangers are automatically slaves, he refuses to believe there is such a law because it isn't in the Torah, but is made a slave anyway.)
So here is my card.....

So how do I toughen up my little girl? How do I teach her to ignore those mean girls and understand that everything they say is only to make themselves feel better because they have their own problems with self-esteem? Bullies just really, really suck.
What she hates even more is when people have to touch her feet. She avoided getting new sneakers for months as she didn’t want to have to try new ones. When forced to get a pedicure for my cousins wedding, she sat there mute and turned a pale colour.
I just don't seem to be able to get my feet under me. Oh, I go and do a bit hoping that seed of effort will bloom into more than idiocy. Somehow, before almost any time, I find myself right back here, writing words, reading what I can, and laughing and cringing at a world gone mad. I'm not really addicted to the net, I'm simply not able to keep my focus on anything. Sure, that could be a sign of addiction, if you believe in pop, and some real, psychology. Going without the net, games, or such just leads to more sleep. I would at least like to be conscious more than not. So, here I sit. Refusing to sleep until... later.
so, here are the rules:

At first sight Mr Self's article smacks of snobbery. He reprises the usual line about novelists not living up to and failing to capitalise on their innovative and modernist moment in the first decades of the 20th century, namely, James Joyce's Ulysses, Proust's Remembrance of Things Past and Virgina Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. Had it carried on in the same vein, Will's article would have ended up in the recycling bin. But his outing contains so many gems, that not discussing them with you, my dear readers and fellow bloggers, is tantamount to treason.

Belittle Tebow if you must. But the trouble with shouting down Tebow’s religion, never mind the sheer offensiveness, is the same trouble with shouting down any other form of inspired expression. Do that, and you also shout down mystery, possibility, surprise. And some perfectly good questions. You drown out an awful lot that’s of interest, whether you agree with it or not.
We are to know our biblical doctrines so not to be deceived by false doctrine. Beware of human cunning by crafty schemes. Paul exhorts the elect to not walk as the gentiles do.

You know, I have to be honest with you I hope this is not what Christians are known for in 30 years because if we are, then people will have greatly misunderstood us, and we will have seriously misrepresented the mission of the Church. You know, it is not the responsibility of the church to solve or stop the HIV/AIDS crisis. I’m sorry, but it is not. That is not the commission that Christ gave us. And the problem with assuming it is, is that we can get so caught up in solving/stopping HIV/AIDS that we never get around to doing the real work that Christ has called us to. This is not to say we shouldn’t be compassionate, helpful, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent like the good Boy Scout church we should be. But I will say this, helping people with any disease and not sharing the Gospel is meaningless. I just cannot see how giving someone a cup of cold water is going to help them when they still end up in hell because we didn’t tell them about the Jesus in whose name it is given. But let me take the point further: Why is it always about HIV/AIDS? Why should Christians be known as leaders in that particular area? What about cancer patients? What about cirrhosis of the liver patients? What about people in Methadone clinics? What about prostitutes, strippers, or pornographers? What about helping homosexuals before HIV/AIDS? What about pediatric AIDS or crack babies? What about emphysema patients? What about being leaders in the fight against RLS? Seriously! Why does it always come back to HIV/AIDS as if that is the only disease ravaging this planet? What about Malaria patients? TB? SARS? Bird-Flu? Anorexia? Bulimia? Paralysis? Common cold? People with HIV/AIDS are not the only people on the planet dying from disease.

From an early age, Staley was exposed to violent and erratic behaviour. His mother attempted to pound a wooden stake through his chest at the age of six or seven and, at a later date, attempted to stab both Staley and his sister with a butcher’s knife. On each occasion she was committed to mental health institutions. Staley’s father was a severe alcoholic and was killed in a road traffic accident in 1985. His maternal grandfather also committed suicide. Staley, himself, subsequently attempted suicide when he was 16 or 17 and was later placed on suicide precautions during his incarceration.
After the coronation, Alexander, with a distant look in his eye, muses that he’s no longer Rodrigo Borgia, but Pope Alexander VI. He’s no longer an “I” but a “We”. Ok, sounds like someone’s been breathing in a little too much incense today. Cesare, who’s with his father as his heavy vestments are removed in an antechamber, tries not to look exasperated and expresses some surprise at how his father’s reacting to his elevation. Alexander continues, saying he’s very alone now, with only the silence of God keeping him company. He asks Cesare to help him interpret this great silence, as his knees buckle. Cesare grabs his father before he hits the ground, but Alexander recovers and allows his son to help him out of the room, still asking Cesare to help him.

Honey Irani appears in front of the camera in one of her first roles as an actress playing the mean and spoilt mommy’s girl Sheila. I love the way she stands and screams as an iron burns her sari rather than just lifting out a hand to move it away. She really does seem to believe she is the delicate flower her mother calls her and she wonderfully nasty towards her cousin. Ranjeet is appropriately sleazy and obviously the villain once he turns up in a selection of increasingly bad shirts and terrible scarves.

Waldemar ends his Christmas wish list by requesting that at least, there will be a time limit imposed upon video art of 2 minutes maximum. But I sit on the cold floor letting Dean's visual poetry wash over me like the cascades of the waterfall in the film. I could give all my time to its entrancing assault on my senses. For me Dean's films is one of those legendary Turbine commissions, like Ai Weiwei's sunflower seeds or Carsten Holler's slide, that I will always be able to say that I saw. It is a lyrical affirmation of the importance of video art in a year of dissent.

I’ve had so much fun doing book challenges this year that I’ve decided to make my own! Unlike most challenges, which run for a calendar year, I’m going to do mine for just the summer. I wanted to start with something short to see how much interest it got, and we'll go from there! Plus, I know a lot of my readers are students or teachers, so summer is the optimal time for you to get lots of reading done. :)

It's good to see that there are some sane judges left in Australia. Most are liberal and criminals are either released or get soft sentences so they can re-offend and be found not guilty over and over. The judge in this case, Mark Dean, seems to have had enough of people using their culture as an excuse to commit violent crimes. The Afghan man who raped a teenager and then went on to rape another woman 5 days later, has been sentenced to 14 years in jail. The man, who is a 'traumatised Muslim Afghan refugee' and has been in Australia since 2001 committed his crimes in 2009 and then went on to blame his cultural differences for the attacks. Apparently his Muslim culture in Afghanistan condones rape of non-Muslim women? Not sure which culture he thinks gives him the right to prey on women, but at least this judge called him on his BS argument and now he's off to jail where he belongs. However, he'll only get to serve just under 8 years before he is eligible for parole. The article notes that he will most likely be deported back to Afghanistan on his release, but I tend to differ. We have seen numerous cases in Australia where these criminals have used our lax political correct Western laws to stay in the country for decades, fighting their deportations - all on the tax payers dime. I would be surprised if this man is sent back to the sandpit he comes from, but stranger things have happened!

The Belle Ball of 1982. I was a freshman. Oh so young. Baby, really. I had a HUGE crush on this boy named Brian. He, unfortunately had a HUGE crush on my best friend at the time, Rachel. I asked him to the Belle Ball. That was painfully hard for me to do, but he said yes, and I was thrilled. So to make it special, the day of the Ball I got my hair cut. Up til then I had long hair that my Mom sort of arranged into a series of Three's Company ponytails. Either one on each side or one high one in the back or whatever. I had that hair whacked off into the most butch dyke haircut you can imagine. But in true 80's style, without products, it looked like a hair helmet. Old lady hair helmet. Oh it was BAD.
Yesterday, I had lunch in a restaurant that was packed with people. I noticed that at the beginning of the meal, the waitress was enthusiastic and happy to wait on us. We were sitting on the outside porch overlooking the water. In this area, people come and go as they please and their seating is not controlled by the hostess assigning tables. Obviously, most of the patrons wanted to be on the porch this warm sunny afternoon because her station soon filled to capacity and beyond. As the people piled into the area, she became overwhelmed, the orders became more complicated and her thrilled excitement slowly seeped away.
As tradition dictates Easter weekend is potato planting time. Whilst waiting for a potato mix to arrive for my show potatoes which I’m growing in bags (Casablanca, Bonnie & Kestrel) I need to get on and plant the rest. I’d like to put some in my allotment as they’re good for working the ground which was pretty compacted when I took over. Most of the seed potatoes I have are 1st and 2nd earlies, Aarron Pilot, Lady Christl, Charlotte, Salad Blue with Pink Fir Apple as well. So planting now will mean some lovely spuds to eat in late July through to September.

The big grey rat ran as fast as he could. Then he thought how very tired he was getting. "What's the use of hurrying?" he said to himself. "The little brown beetle can not possibly win. If I were racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different." Then he started to run more slowly but every time his heart beat it said, "Hurry up! Hurry up!" The big grey rat decided that it was best to obey the little voice in his heart so he hurried just as fast as he could.
Nearly 10,000 ordinary Chinese folk had turned up to support Dong Zong to protest the lack of Chinese primary school teachers, even chasing away MCA Deputy Education Minister Wee Ka Siong from the event. This rally – for the usually politically-timid Chinese – is a landmark and a real warning for the UMNO-BN. It is the Chinese equivalent of the 2007 Hindraf rally where 30,000 Malaysians – most of Indian origin – protested against their racial marginalization by the UMNO government.

In 2006, when I was in Peru at the SpiritQuest lodge, don Howard talked with me about how Ayahuasca works with us in terms of visions, healing, and influence in our lives. He said something curious that when I first heard it, I wondered if it was true. He told me that the visions we receive may be powerful, fearful, wonderful, or they may not come at all. “They are important,” he said, “but the real work that Ayahuasca will do with you will occur later. About three months after you get home – that is when you should look for the real effects of the medicine to manifest in your life.”

My work on this book reminded once again of an amazing phenomenon I have often experienced when writing. As my writing gains momentum, it as if the book is writing itself! In Woman, the characters took on lives of their own. Sometimes I was excited to just sit at my keyboard and find out what was going to happen. Even though the story was coming to life through my very own fingers, I couldn’t be sure what my characters were going to do until they did it! And I couldn’t anticipate where the day’s writing was going to end up until the end of the session. And when I finally saw that my characters had done all they were going to do for the day – well, then, I sighed.
Director of Technical Quality, GRS Group Bill Tryon is Technical Director for Global Realty Services Group, where he is responsible for due diligence standards for environmental, property condition and seismic due diligence as well as construction monitoring. During his thirty years in the industry, Bill has developed risk management policies and procedures for one of the world’s real estate lenders and has participated with governmental agencies to refine policies and requirements. Bill first became involved in environmental due diligence in 1988, before the creation of current industry standards. As Chief of Construction and Environmental Services for a major real estate lender, he developed independent standards for the completion an evaluation of environmental assessment activities. In the mid-90’s he became a founding member of the Environmental Bankers Association. As committee chair for various committees, he worked to assure an in-depth understanding of environmental issues across the membership. More recently, he has consulted with the Small Business Administration and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding environmental policies, participated in the Environmental Protection Agency’s development of standards governing “all appropriate inquiry” and presented various topics at EPA Brownfield and other industry forums. During his involvement with the early development of due diligence standards to support early CMBS lending programs, Bill worked to refine broad industry standards to produce scopes of work more specific to lending risks, resulting in price reductions of nearly 40%. Additional cost reductions were realized by implementation of a “small loan” assessment. Bill’s ability to cut the fat away from standardized industry products helped control risks while reducing costs and creating a competitive advantage. In 1989, after California’s Loma Prieta earthquake, Bill became involved in the evaluation of earthquake risks associated with owned properties as well as the loan portfolio of a major real estate lender. Since no standardized approach to the evaluation of such portfolios existed at that time, he was forced to become familiar with the principles of earthquake risk assessment in order to develop appropriate corporate policies. As the market expanded, he extended his approach to portfolio analysis to include the evaluation of CMBS loans. It quickly became apparent that the industry and even many of the consultants involved in the analysis earthquake risks had a limited understanding of the variables which can significantly impact the conclusions of such studies. Bill adopted and defended criteria appropriate to a portfolio-level evaluation of risks which was eventually validated by ASTM International standards published in 2007.

The Catholic church is the biggest financial power, wealth accumulator and property owner in existence.

These days the image of a salesman has changed dramatically. The familiar door-to-door salesman has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Now we have guys flashing brochures of gutters and siding, and Girl Scouts tempting us with boxes of calorie-laden goodness. Many salesmen these days have been replaced by buttons on our computer's that say "add to cart" and "buy now", and UPS guys in crisp brown uniforms approaching our front doors carrying packages. We also now have, what are called "traveling salesman." They're called this because they spend half their lives driving to the four corners of the earth in search of customers to sell things to.

I’ve been thinking about the Zoroastrian idea of truth, which is called “Asha”, the cousin of the Hindu principle Rta. Asha and Rta both represent universal order, but Asha carries a strong moral connotation. It connotes societal order that results from honesty in human relations. It is such honesty that is the fabric of human commerce, and I am using the broadest definition of “commerce,” including not only the exchange of goods and services, but also intellectual commerce, social commerce, cultural commerce, and even spiritual commerce. Without honesty and trustworthiness, commerce cannot thrive and society loses its very fabric. Hence it can be seen that the two named characteristics of Good and Evil in Zoroastrianism—Asha and Druj—exhibit the emphasis that Zoroastrianism places on human relations, i.e., commerce.

Of course, anyone can make a poached asparagus with hollandaise sauce–though I am told this is the most popular way to eat the vegetable. It takes a certain level of skill to look past the stalk and really transform the asparagus (and yet still keep its unique flavor). Piccolo Angolo does this in spades with their asparagus ravioli. A special on their menu, the asparagus is pureed when fresh and folded into yummy ravioli pockets. All of this freshness brought to your plate equates to booking a flight straight to Italy and putting your face down in a big bowl of asparagus–but without the woody texture. A definite try for those who love asparagus and love to try something new!

Hospitals: From early in church history, members and leaders recognized the importance of meeting the physical needs of members, as well as spiritual needs.

It got me thinking about the “causes” of collisions. We know that the driver’s action, attitude, and choices are strong contributor factors in 90% (or more) of the collisions reported annually. However, I don’t think I know anyone who’d be willing to argue that drivers choose to be involved in a collision. At the same time, I don’t think they would defend the idea that collisions happen by pure chance, either.
On Thursday, Sep. 15, Planned Parenthood of North Texas hosted a presentation by Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, to discuss their lawsuit against the state of Texas’s new sonogram law. The event, called “Trust Texas Women,” was held at the First Unitarian Church of Dallas, and I attended, ostensibly as a concerned pro-choicer, although no one asked me my affiliation.

Honestly, I could not afford to go all out on food. We had the party from 12:30-2:30. I worded the invitation to say "Make sure you eat lunch before you come but save room for cupcake and lemonade." to let everyone know I would not be serving a lot of food.

Using the pre-drilled holes, he cut out one-half of the circle at a time. After the first circular cut, we tested a rim to make sure it fit. Then Mr. GI cut out the other three circles and we tried all four holes with rims and jars.
The exaggerated reports however on the compensation culture are misleading. Most people don't sue for every little thing, and many of those who do don't get anything. And, actually, I agree that when one's safety has been compromised by someone else overlooking or ignoring the rules, one should be compensated. Not in the case of an accident, unless due to reckless driving. But a shop has a duty to keep its floors clean of spilt liquids. If someone slips and breaks a hip on a spilt drink which the shop have not cleaned up within a reasonable amount of time surely the injured party should be allowed to sue.
Now that you have your list, pick one thing on the list. A girlfriend of mine started with getting her teeth whitened. That was week one for her. When she saw how great her smile was after the whitening, every time she wanted a cigarette she would look in the mirror at her pretty white teeth and remind herself what would happen if she smoked a cigarette. And no she didn’t stop completely over night. But this helped her cut back quickly. The second week, she started going out for a walk every morning before work. Not a jog or even a power walk, just a leisurely stroll around her neighborhood. Over time this progressed into running for exercise, but she started slow. Week three she had her hair colored and styled in a way she’d always wanted but never tried before. Over time she started to feel like a new person and the cigarettes became less important.

I felt so queasy when I came across this one – little Swiss Heidi in the company of the man with the filthiest imagination in Europe – that I broke my rule and rearranged them. They’re no longer even on the same floor – the Marquis’ new neighbour is a book about the rules of the game of boules, which should keep him out of trouble, and Heidi is now safely snuggled up to Squirrel Nutkin.

First up was How to Write Great Screenplays: And Get Them into Production by Linda M. James… which intrigued me largely because it was written from the perspective of a Brit, rather than a Hollywood-ite… but, aside from some useful addresses and competition info in the later chapters, I found the contents quite flimsy and feeble. I also think it’s a bit odd that, despite being a woman herself, Ms. James only ever referenced films with male leads, and constantly referred to potential protagonists as “He” or “Him”. Tch! Films with female leads can win fancy awards too, y’know?
There is something to be gained from the consistency and predictability of daffodils, a sense of comfort that they will grow no matter what happens. Arts organizations do differ from daffodils in a significant way; we are constantly reliant on the generosity and patronage of others to make the work we do possible. Artistic experiences are a significant part of what makes life worth living; a little extra care and feeding is necessary to make the arts grow in a community.

I suppose you could call this a zombie novel, which is why it is all the more extraordinary that I am including it in this list. Anybody who knows me even slightly will be aware that I loathe zombies like the plague. But what Marr has done with this novel is a laudable feat of re-imagining the genre, and I salute her for it (whilst still shuddering gently). Rebekkah Barrow is the reluctant inheritor of her grandmother Maylene's post as Graveminder to the small town of Claysville, where the dead are walking, unquiet and needing to be laid to rest. This is a new departure for Marr, best known for her Wicked Lovely faery series, and I will be fascinated to see where she takes Rebekkah's story next.

Another great source of community I have enjoyed since January, and boy have I learned a lot, is the wide world of blogging. Many writers share their writing online, resources, and their thoughts on things they’ve learned about writing. There are plenty of writing prompts offered on blogs as well. Some of the ones I like are Be Kind Rewrite has writing prompts on the blog called Inspiration Monday and Rosemary Mint has prompts on Thursday Melting. There are probably many more to be explored out there. It can be nice to use a writing prompt on one of those days nothing is coming to mind which I want to write about or just for the fun of it or as a challenge.

Everybunny should have this cute set especially if you enjoy coloring. I cased this adorable card from Mary-Jo's blog ( Technostamper). She did such a great job with the layouts and designs. I cased this card with just a few minor changes. I wanted to put ribbon where her sentiment was, added the Crystal Effects in the balloon. Hope you like it.

Hours into date three, we’re listening to Nina Simone, drinking sweet white wine. I – eyelashes batting – finally ask, coy as can be, “so, don’t you want to kiss me?”
I have been waiting for you all year. I kept telling myself that if I could make it to November it would all be "smooth sailing" from here. No pun intended...okay, maybe a little pun!
But, I will try to share a lot of my ‘fake-meat’ recipes that I’ve used over the years over the next month. Typically, I don’t prepare or eat a lot of ‘fake-meat’ as I have never met a vegetable I didn’t like; there’s an endless variety of foods and recipes that a vegetarian can eat and prepare without having to eat things like tofu and tempeh. But, now and then I do get a hankering for some bacon to go with a big, juicy tomato on a BLT, or a Reuben sandwich, or just something a bit more substantial in my soup or stew pot than just veggies.
Then just unroll and use as you normally would. We taped them to the wall in a criss-cross pattern over the food table. Smile politely when your husband says, "I didn't know where you were going with those babe, but now they look cool!" Resist the urge to scream, "In yo face!" or "Wait until you see what color I'm painting the Dining Room!"
In the final part of this series, the concept of cloud storage will be explored further. Cloud storage, simply put, is the concept of storing information in secure locations online rather than on a hard disk on a PC, laptop or server. This has obvious benefits to both businesses and home users, not least enabling data backup and sharing, as well as device synchronising (Gladinet and iCloud). By utilising clustering and load balancing technologies, these solutions offer a much reduced risk to data loss through hardware failure. Furthermore, cloud storage is incredibly flexible and responsive to actual needs. Where traditionally, a business would have to purchase a SAN (or server in smaller cases) capable of not only supporting the existing needs but also the expected growth in needs over the SAN/ server’s lifespan, cloud storage allows business to rapidly increase their storage capacity and thus reduce wasted expenditure.
Working at an event like that is something that I really like to do. It's so different from what I do at my "regular" job. It's like working at the Gift Mart in Atlanta or on the vendor floor at a scrapbooking convention. If anyone is looking for help at a similar event, please let me know!!
This 5-part series is about how I would correct/fix various design issues within the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). This is not about how I would change bus routes, or how one mode is better or worse than another mode (i.e., LRT vs. Subway). This is about how I believe the TTC (and other transit authorities) can improve the experience of engaging and interacting with it’s ridership (actual and potential). Here is part five.
I spend a while exploring the interior of church, which has much of interest: the pendulum which, unusually, descends from the clock tower above to sway slowly to and fro above the crossing; the original cherubic ‘quarter boys’ which once stood outside high up on the clock tower (their places now taken with modern replicas); Norman arches on the west side of the north transept. But the highlight of any visit is the chance to ascend the tower. I pay my £2.50, and climb a narrow staircase, to an even narrower stone passageway, from where one can look down onto the crossing and chancel far below. Barely wide enough for one, let alone for two people to pass, I have to reverse three times to allow people to descend (banging my head on a timber roof truss each time), then climb time-worn stone steps into the ringing room. A wooden tablet on the wall commemorates the ringing of ‘A Peal of Grandsire Triples, 5040 Changes, A Variation of Holt’s Ten-Part’ on ‘Monday May 30th 1898 in Three Hours and Two Minutes’. Opposite, the clock mechanism, dating from 1561 and one of the oldest working church clock mechanisms in the country, continues to mark time, as it has done for 450 years. A steep wooden staircase leads up into the belfry, where the bells – not those stolen by the French in 1377, but ones cast in 1775 – hang still and silent. A narrow wooden walkway leads across the gloom of the belfry, through the slimmest of doors out into bright light and fresh air on the tower parapet.
My pastor at Colonial Hills Baptist Church (Taylors, SC) preached another sermon this evening in a series on biblical worship. It was another great installment in the series. Because his points were so valuable, I want to share all six of them here.

As a child of about six or seven at the time, I had read all about them in various books and magazines with unbounded fascination, and implored my parents to take me to see these wonderful dogs that could sing. When I reached their enclosure, one of them was at that very moment entertaining an enraptured audience with a thrilling rendition in falsetto fortissimo, so I eagerly thrust my way through the throng to obtain a closer view — a little too close for comfort, as it turned out.

Do I need to remind you all that we live in the Midwest? I know the weather has been absolutely BEAUTIFUL, but, again - we live in the Midwest. There are probably at least 1/2 dozen mornings ahead of us where the temperature will be below 32 degrees, and we know you all despise this.

“African-Americans have had the same or greater interest rates in entrepreneurship (as other racial/ethnic groups),” says Woodard, a sociologist who has researched work-force diversity and labor force patterns. As evidence, he cited recent U.S. Census data. In July, the Census Bureau released its “Preliminary Estimates of Business Ownership by Gender, Ethnicity, Race and Veteran Status: 2007” report that revealed a 45.6 percent increase in the number of minority-owned businesses from 2002 to 2007.

Mine is a classic case of BICHOK (butt in chair hands on keyboard). In 2005, I started seriously writing with the clear goal to get a New York publishing contract. After penning five dark, edgy romantic thrillers and a YA with dark undertones, I needed something with a little more light and laughter. Something fun. I wrote CHLOE but didn’t submit to my agent because it was so different from what I’d written in the past. No serial killers or painful family secrets. Just a big-hearted heroine with a closet full of great old shoes.

Oh how I absolutely love this movie. I don’t care about being laughed at that this film is ranked so high. I am huge fan of the series and I think the chemistry between these two is at a level that is missing in films today. This was the ultimate buddy film series. And this was easily the best and funniest in my book. I watched this movie while waiting for the furniture delivery man – with that amazing 4 – 8 hr delivery window – a few weeks ago. To me it’s a personal classic. I believe that the chemistry between these two main characters will never be duplicated. And it was back before we knew just how crazy Mel Gibson really is.

Today myself and Dave were on plot P26 for a few hours again. We made a gate using some old trellis donated from my parents back garden. Dave simply hammered the trellis onto two wooden stakes and the gate was done. It’s a little narrow to fit perfectly between my gate posts so we’ll have to add another piece of wood to it. I realised I forgot to bring hinges though so we’ll just have to hang it next time we get down. I’m thinking I might paint it, give it a bit of personality. I’ve been admiring many of the other plots on site and am amazed at the creativity I’ve seen, especially when it comes to things like gates and fencing.

As the buzz grows louder around words like ‘placemaking’ and ‘creative economy,’ it’s interesting to see the ways that cities vary in the authenticity of their efforts to embrace these concepts. While some communities take the approach of re-branding existing efforts to contort themselves into a creative placemaking mold (particularly when there’s grant money on the table), Salem, MA appears to be responding particularly proactively. That North Shore city of some 40,000 just received a $25,000 grant through the “Our Town” program of the National Endowment for the Arts (an opportunity we posted in January’s newsletter) to fund a public art master plan. The resulting plan is intended to focus on integrating public art in an existing pedestrian mall while making improvements to traffic patterns and parking.
And Mr. 7 has no interest and no idea- I don't mean anything bad by this AT ALL! Believe me I am very proud of him and his ability to stay true to himself. He has a passion for art and has said since he was 3 that "When I grow up I am going to be an artist. Actually.... I already am one!" (He is my child responsible for all manner of magnificent philosophical statements as mentioned on an earlier post.)
The complex nature of both the condition and interventions has made it difficult to pin down precisely why stroke units are so successful. “The general consensus is that it is about multidisciplinary teams working effectively together, having stroke specific staff, easy access to imaging and other necessary investigations, as well as involving patients and their carers in rehabilitation,” says Rudd.

I definitely don't have an answer for this one. I find it curious that only 13 percent of women keep their names after marriage. Do women change their names out of habit or tradition? For the sake of their children so that they'll have a "family" name? Answers, please!Though I don't begrudge anyone the opportunity to change her name, I am surprised that more women don't keep their given names after marriage. I have no desire to change my name if I get married. I grew up Danielle Brown and I intend to stay Danielle Brown. It's the name on my birth certificate, my report cards, my diploma, and my driver's license. My parents gave me a name that fits me. Why would I want to change it?
She and my mum argue from time to time too. In fact all the women in our family are strong-willed - we're a bit difficult at times - and noisy when we're all together, each clamouring to be heard above the rest. But I wouldn't have it any other way... we're resilient - a necessary attribute for any female and one I've always tried to encourage in my own two girls.
The place had seven communal cells, some of which used to be storerooms for the Portuguese colonisers, and five isolation cells, crowded so much that a mere turn of a sleeping position by a single prisoner would awaken the whole cell.
I always thought I was a good communicator. After all I it had been the way I made my livelihood back in my working day, not so very long ago.

Yet, for some reason, you are out there protesting Israel (the most ‘gay friendly’ country in the Middle East) and supporting Palestine (who is controlled by Hamas, who I already pointed out would happily murder you).

In retrospect I also see that she was wanting me to do things that would "make it all ok." It started with- if I could have magically fixed it so that the dolphins could have splashed her, if I could promise her that next time we went to the zoo she'd get splashed, if we could come back tomorrow so that she'd get splashed then, if, if, if, if!!! When I could not make her dolphin experience any different then it was, those "ifs" morphed into- if I bought more tickets, if I bought more ice cream, if we went on all the rides again, THEN things would be fine....

Every bullycide story breaks my heart because I believe it could’ve been prevented. Bullycide is a failure of the adults surrounding the bullied child…and the bully. Oftentimes it is an unintentional failure. Many adults simply don’t know how to help. They fear they will do or say the wrong thing—make the situation worse. Or the help they do provide is ineffective and fails to make the necessary impact.

Le Couvent de la Tourette
For years I saved a bar of Pears soap sent to me by my mother one Christmas. She sent a few bars but I used the others, saving this last one for a special time. September 2011 blasted my brain, eroding trust in all relationships in my life from friends to family to people I had known since I was 19 years old. My skin reacted, as it did once when I was with a sister when the skin of bare forearms touched a shopping cart, if I remember correctly. I immediately broke out in hives and my sister couldn’t believe the reaction spreading up my arms from the wrist area. “I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it myself,” she said.

Now here I am months later, a significantly different person after significant life changes who hasn't touched her third novel in too long.

Jonathan’s medal was definitely the best part of the experience, but watching from the corner was huge fun in itself. The energy and excitement are nothing like being in the seats, and the atmosphere of enjoyment is much different. Evidently it continued into the night – as we left the rink, we saw that it was outfitted with colored lights and Meatloaf (Paradise By The Dashboard Light) blasting from the speakers, and people were dancing (and drinking) and seemed set up to keep the party going for who-knows-how-long.

Nothing appeared to be broken, but he couldn't answer my questions appropriately. Things just didn't seem right with him, so off to the hospital we went. Long story short...he suffered a skull fracture with bleeding on his brain and a severe concussion. We spent two long and worrisome days in the hospital before they thought it was safe to let him go home.

My mom had another scan on Tuesday to see how her tumors were reacting to the chemo. From the outside, from what we could observe, she seemed to be doing great. Since she started chemo she’s been breathing better, looking better, able to walk and talk and go out and do things that prior to her treatment she could not do. The chemo never exhausted her, made her sick, nauseous, or anything. Her hair has only started to thin and she still has so much that she hasn’t had to wear a wig yet. Her doctor could feel that one of the tumors in her lymph node had shrunk, and the fact that she was breathing easier seemed to be proof that the tumors in her lungs were shrinking.
With five people in the house, and four of them who definitely need a daily shower, the morning has a fine-tuned beast of a schedule, ensuring that everyone who needs one ends up showered, dressed, generally presentable, and ready to head out the door for school/work by 8:30. This schedule is mostly determined by the time it takes the water heater to reheat water to ensure that Dear Husband (who is last on the schedule) will have enough warm water to get through his shower without freezing to death.
This afternoon my wife and I were busy installing a screen door in the rear of our home. Warm and sunny, an old door laying in the garage needed a new lease on life. And modification.
What an aroma! Acetic with some caramel and hints of funk in the back. Jo thought the funk was a little odd but I felt like it was exactly what you'd expect from an Flanders Red style sour. Started with some tart cherry which was followed by light vinegar and caramel sweetness. The vinegar wasn't as strong in the flavor as in the aroma but the right balance was still struck between it and the sweetness. Just really delicious. I've read they do a sour cherry version which must be awesome. Too bad we'll probably never see it around here.

Oh boy I just received a check in the mail for $3,990.00!!! It looks like the real thing and came with a letter from G.T.Express Financial Services Inc. in NY, although the check itself has Presbyterian Village in Little Rock, AR on it as the owner and it came in an envelope postmarked Little Rock with no return address. Hmmm, time to investigate.... Oh yeah, the check is to go towards the "applicable Government Service Tax (GST) payable to the Revenue Department through your assigned tax agent" so I can get my $120,000.00! Sheesh! If only....

For the record, I don't have a particular problem with Kristen Stewart or the movies. I actually think there's a hilarious campiness quality to the final Twilight book. (Blackout sex! Vampire babies! Incisor c-sections! Man-on-newborn love! Magic powers! A climax where an American revolutionary-era vampire lectures an evil European vampire about individual liberty! Total fake out on the final battle! More blackout sex!) In essence, you need to read it as if Leslie Nielsen is playing Edward and Anna Faris is playing Bella.

#90: Met new people at salsa party. These salsa dancin’ folks keep showing up in my blog, and that’s because there are so dang many of them, and they’re all such great people! I met a handful more at their most recent gathering, and befriended someone who is just as big a Queen and classic rock fan as I am. In fact, he was a roadie for Journey when he was a youngin’. JEALOUS MUCH.
"The number of fines issued on the DLR have increased from approx 15,000 in 2007 to approx 17,500pa in 2010 but – and it’s a big “but” – the number of passenger has also increased from 65m to 75m. So fines have increased but only in line with passenger numbers. These fines are also not pure profit as there are substantial costs involved in mounting ticket inspection operations.

I have not (yet) needed an icebreaker to get to a Princes Street Hogmanay party, nor have I required heavy artillery to defend myself while there. The gentle warmth of that ocean current ensures the seas off Western Scotland remain a balmy 12 degrees C in the depths of December, and this I know for a fact for I have donned scuba amidst snow flurries on the deck of a fishing trawler in the waters off Oban in the week before Christmas and plunged into the depths just for the sheer hell of it.
The weekend after 14 July, we went to Lille on the first part of our extended Grand Tour. (Later highlights will include Rome and Prague, amongst others.) We had an awesome time. The north of France has a bit of a bad reputation, so I wasn't expecting great things, but Lille is beautiful, friendly, accessible - I'd move there, if it weren't for the fact that I'd die of a heart attack within a week because all of the food is so, so calorie dense. High-calorie meals (beer-soaked bread with toasted cheese on top, surrounded by a cheese, cream and beer sauce, for example) probably made sense when everyone in the region was working in textile mills and the like. Not so much these days...

This is different from weeding. That dead wood had a function. It was once a living part of the bush or shrub. Without it, there would be no future growth. But its time has passed. It's tangled and unsightly. It distracts the eye from the beauty of the new shoots. At worst, it can strangle those fragile new buds and prevent them flourishing.
Firstly, according to the aforementioned dictionary, a tulip flower “stands for self-confidence; encouragement; motivational factors; may also point to a beautiful beginning.” The beginning of a bona fide spring would feel pretty terrific right now. I’m not holding my breath. Is the universe telling me not to plan that move to Arizona, that spring will indeed come even to Alaska?
I hope you enjoyed my pictures! Have a wonderful rest of the weekend. I think I'm going to take some NyQuil and go lay down. I can't be sick...I have to much to do!
This kind of approach needs to be leveled with teasing YET with flirting so that it’s not a weird or awkward transition to later ask her for the digits. IOW’s the playful banter/teasing needs to always have a foundation in showing an intimate interest and need to move to the next level. Basically, there should be no surprises when you go from cracking a joke and she’s in tears laughing and just as she is catching her breathe from laughing so hard you drop the hammer and ask for her number and she’s like “WTF?”.
Finally, the Commission failed to consider the efficiencies that package licensing may produce because of the innovative character of the technology at hand. Given that the technology surrounding the Orange Book standard was still evolving, there were many uncertainties regarding what patents might be needed to produce the compact discs. As noted, package license agreements in which the royalty was based on the number of units produced, not the number of patents used to produce them, can resolve in advance all potential patent disputes between the licensor and the licensee, whereas licensing patent rights on a patent-by-patent basis can result in continuing disputes over whether the licensee’s technology infringes certain ancillary patents owned by the licensor that are not part of the group elected by the licensee.

May 2005 District judge rules Nebraska version Unconstitutional (he is later overturned)
These girls certainly don't have the agency and power of the children in A High Wind in Jamaica, and none of them have become as rebellious as the children in Who Can Kill a Child?, but they are not automatons. The freedom given to the older children at the end of the film is clearly delightful and full of new mysteries, possibilities, and dangers -- the teachers may be sad to see the children's innocence and disappearing and to see them liberated from the structures that kept them ignorant, but the children move in the final scene from trepidation to unbridled joy and, yes, self-determination. The sullen adults who live and work at the school have gone back to the school to recapture their innocence, a time when they were happy, but they have obviously failed: going back is not possible and will only lead to resigned sadness. There is no evidence in the film against, and plenty for, the idea of moving on into knew challenges, new worlds, new games, new knowledge.
“My darling boy,” she said. “Lord Harrington used to be an old friend of mine. Oh, don’t be surprised. Indeed, we have been lovers when I was very young.

The film's sensuality is joined with its low-key suspense in the scene where Daisy takes a bath, stripping out of her clothes as steam from the water swirls around her, Hitchcock's editing playfully suggesting her impending nudity while cutting away just a second before she'd actually show anything immodest to the camera. In a distant hint of the bathroom terror of Psycho, Hitchcock then suggests that the lodger is going to break into the room: there's something so vulnerable about getting naked to bathe, and even at this early point in his career Hitchcock hints at what it would be like to get attacked like this. But of course, everything in this film is a feint, a misdirection, so once again the lodger's initially sinister-seeming actions turn out to be innocent. Hitchcock wanted to leave the resolution of the story ambiguous, as it was in the Marie Belloc Lowndes novel it's based on, but in a pattern that would recur several times in Hitchcock's later star vehicles, the studio didn't want to imply that a handsome matinee idol like Novello could be a killer.
Then you get to my twins...the two that changed our lives in very different ways...born at 23 weeks...a whole 17 weeks early! They taught us how to face challenges of chronic illnesses and special needs. How to deal with a death of a child and the grief that follows it...all the while still "swimming" for the sake of the surviving twin the even years later is struggling daily, the other beautiful kids at home that had to deal with losing a brother and having the other sick constantly dealing with the special needs that he has...and finally for our marriage...because no one talks about the stress that loss and sickness can wreck havoc on a marriage. We are stronger, grew closer because of it!

Not too long ago, Mommy received an email invitation from Huggies Malaysia to attend an event called "Huggies Play Date" at Saujana Hotel, Subang. Mommy reckoned that Mommy was invited not because Huggies know whether Mommy is a mummy blogger or not, but rather because Mommy's name is in their mailing list since Mommy joined the Huggies Club long time ago to get some free diaper samples. ^_^

President Obama has now signed the America Invents Act (AIA) into law, following a process which began when Congress and US industry first sought to overhaul the US patent system in 2004 and which draws US practice closer to the patent laws of the rest of the world than has previously been the case.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba – Unexpectedly weak U.S. jobs data shows the recovery there is lumpy, but both the U.S. and Canadian economies can still be expected to grow this year, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Friday.
I took a job at the Elementary School in the afternoons so my time is so limited and since I am creating the program for these after-school kids, most of my creative energy goes there. But the new year breathes new life into my soul and spirit and now it is time to get things moving forward.
Near the end of the day, Lefty and I lamented that many Japanese brewers are now retrenching, scaling back on their more adventuresome and experimental beers, and settling for milder lineups. The once wonderful Minoh WIPA has not been really tasty for at least a year; Ise Kadoya's Imperial Red seems to be much tamer than what they offered at the Kyoto Beer Fest. Perhaps these brewers are reacting to popular taste and focusing on their best-selling and least flavorful brews. And, my word, just look at how popular Johana's absurd light pink and blue happoshu beers have been at festivals.

I really wanted to start stitching on some of my cards, but me and the sewing machine don't get on - I did have another go with it a couple of days ago, but I couldn't even thread the blimmin' thing lol. So I decided to have a go at hand-stitching on today's card, and I'm quite pleased with it really :o) Maybe one day I'll work the sewing machine out, but at least I can do it this way until then!

Remember when the progressives/Democrats/liberals celebrated Obama repealing the 'Don't ask, Don't tell' policy? Well, since then, sexual assaults on males has increased in the military. Non-consensual sodomy attacks are now 7% of attacks, with a reported 20% increase in male sexual assaults. This is what happens when these idiots don't think the consequences through of their warm and fuzzy ideology that they jump up and down to impose on others. And these are the numbers on reported cases. How many go unreported due to feelings of shame by the victim? And then added to this are the attacks on females in the military which increases every year. The Army refuses to follow recommendations to end gender-integrated basic training as the report found that it resulted in less discipline, less unit cohesion, and more distraction. And of course, more sexual assaults on the females. No matter how they wish it, the genders will never be physically, emotionally or sexually equal. And now added to this mix is the legalising of homosexuality to further encourage in-your-face perverse behavior. The USSR didn't need to fight the US military with their own military - all they had to do was inject political correctness at all levels to do the job for them...I wonder if the Soviets also have such a soft military? But hey, at least the Gays are now happy.

Each one of those red targets represents a “Targeted Republican.”You’ll never guess where I found this map. That’s right, it’s on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) website. They launched the site and the map on February 23rd of this year, making it just over a month old. And yet Van Hollen was quoted by Politico just today denouncing Republicans for “pouring more and more gasoline on the flames.” Right back at you, pal. …

Discovered Authors (now Callio Press) is a UK publisher and provider of author solutions services since 2005. I have been aware of them for the past three to four years. The company was one of the earliest UK author solution services I took a look at, but consistently, I have had to put off reviewing them for a number of reasons I will touch upon later. At a certain point, when I review a publisher or author solutions service, I have to decide when it is an appropriate time to go live with it. For this particular review—it is now or never.

Mr. Bull said the "clear purpose" of what the Panthers were doing was to "intimidate voters with whom they did not agree." He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: "You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker."
The Krillitanes were bat-like humanoids, though smaller than Humans. They had various shades of skin ranging from pinkish to charcoal gray, sharp claws and a flattened, fanged face. They took their bat-like wings from the inhabitant of Bessan, and they also sleep upside down like bats and have very sensitive hearing. As well as a bat-form, the Krillitanes can create a morphic illusion of a Human (which Mr Finch preferred). Krillitanes are carnivorous and will eat other sentient creatures, but they will also eat rats. They also produced Krillitane oil which can increase intelligence in humans but is currently deadly for Krillitanes. They are aware of the Time Lords and their extinction.

I always enjoy visiting with Pete. He said he and his wife will be at the concert Saturday to hear my new "Fire & Ice" song. Which, in a flurry of techiness, I burned to a CD for him to play on the air as a sneak preview of the concert. Which, of course, didn't work when he tried to play it.

I've definitely slowed down a lot with my reading. I keep getting distracted with other things like TV, movies, comics, and video games. Only so much free time to go around, and the books are piling up!
I suppose that if you turned this quilt on its side, it would be the "stacked coins" traditional pattern, but since I'm putting it the other way, it looks like books on shelves to me, and that's why I'm calling it Books I Have Read. All the fabrics except the border were in my scrap bin, leftovers from other projects. Once I decided it looked like books on shelves, I scrounged through six or seven quilt shops before I found what I wanted for the border fabric - printed words - in a quilt shop in Napa. I had to have a very wide border in order to make it big enough to cover my double doors.
this built in cabinetry was all white, but i came up with a plan to make the chic city condo a bit more stylish by adding a chocolate brown backing, then a solid chocolate line to the bevels in the doors - much more stylish!
While all of the above COULD be solved, it is HIGHLY unlikely, if not dead-bang impossible. The new government is just like the old government, and the power of the unions says there will no austerity. It already has been invoked, but not executed.
The NUMBER ONE thing you have to know and remind yourself when making your stays is that the empire waistline is KEY. You mess with that, you will have problems. Your garments are designed to fit around this elevated waistline which runs directly under the base of your bust, and if you are not getting the proper lift, or your gussets are too low, your gown’s cut and placing will suffer.

Imaginary Future is pleasant enough to listen to in the background, and most songs contain nice hooks to keep the audience going in live context. Songs like You Don’t Know and Convict are catchy sing-along chants that are sure to get a few ‘o-o-o-ooos’ out of you.
ANYWAYS... I looked at this angel clock and went WHOA!!!! The face looks SO much like the little faces I've been making in my studio lately. Then I went WHOA!!!

The zombies came out of the water and started tearing up the town. By tearing up the town, of course, I mean gingerly pushing chairs over at the local watering hole. I should mention that in this montage of zombie action (I use that term loosely) we see many more pairs of French breasts. Starkwell definitely has one foot out the door. The novelty of this film wore off of Lovelock about ten boobies ago. Considering how they just rose from the water in those thick army jackets, “they all look remarkably dry”, noted Starkwell. The villagers form a posse to take out the Nazi zombies.
The response from Umno Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein was a study in contrast to Khalid’s. It was clear Hisham was laying the ground for the Najib administration’s next course of action – to blame the Pakatan and Bersih for instigating the unruliness.
Even as a by-the-numbers action/adventure film, The Mummy manages to pull off a few things that so many other films don’t. The story, for all intents and purposes, is interesting and completely coherent. Its characters are quirky, fun and memorable, especially Rachel Weisz and John Hannah. But best of all: there’s rarely (if ever) a single moment you aren’t entertained to some extent. The Mummy is just a wonderful popcorn flick with enough substance to help it stand higher than most of its siblings.
Unfortunately for the Sprouts, yet again they may be hoist by their own petard. The very legal-heavy structure they created means the Hungarians could run the Commission round in circles for years: without action in response from the Orban regime, the European Court of Justice—the EU’s highest court—will be used by Brussels to adjudicate. Anyone who has ever appealed to this Mad Hatter’s Tea Party will know that the Third Millennium celebrations may well be looming before it makes a decision. After that – even if the ECJ finds Hungary in breach of EU Law – it’s hard to see what the EU or the IMF could do about it apart from withhold funds.

Rain pattered down on Godl's head, carrying with it the cool green mutterings of the god Chaac that drifted out of the sky. The jaguar moved not a muscle, his blocky head a graven image amongst the leaf shadows. The occasional blink and breath was the only sign Godl was alive. He had been days on the ridge, and hunger was calling his name.

AB: What stands out to me the most was how much the NHL seemed NOT to want to pursue expansion, even when they were actively involved in doing so. It seemed that they only expanded because they felt they had to, regardless of their personal opinions about the act itself. Harold Ballard of the Maple Leafs was surely against it, but then again, there wasn’t much that he liked, other than money. But when all was said and done, even though two of the teams that were added no longer exist (Minnesota North Stars and Oakland Seals), expansion was clearly a success. It helped grow the game like the league had never seen, and finally put the NHL on par with the other three major professional sports leagues in the country.

I barely worried about my weight at all for the first 30 years of my life, so it's odd focusing on it like this. But when I weighed over 11 stone (as I did after Lily was born) I found it hard to breathe, let alone walk around easily. Being lighter means I have far more energy - which I need to carry this little thing around:
Falling for the ploy.
Inner awareness is what Mr Palomar wants, and he hopes to achieve it by increased consciousness of his surroundings. But he looks so hard that sometimes he cannot see what matters. Rather than enjoy it, he feels guilty when he cannot identify the bird a song belongs to. He feels he “must go and look at the stars … because he hates waste and believes it is wrong to waste the great quantity of stars that is put at his disposal.” Looking down as well as up, he contemplates his lawn: “the lawn’s purpose is to represent nature, and this representation occurs as the substitution of the nature proper to the area with a nature in itself natural but artificial for this area.” (Yes, there are many sentences in Mr Palomar that you need to read twice. Really, it is a book that you need to read twice.) He watches the daytime moon, “porous as a sponge”, solidify as night falls into a “lake of shininess … brimming in the darkness with a halo of cold silver.” As he considers the world around him, questioning everything he sees, he reflects that “perhaps it is this same distrust of our senses that prevents us from feeling comfortable in the universe.” He extends his discomfiture to mankind generally: to think as he does is to bring on unsettling uncertainties. Ignorance is bliss, if only he could see it.

Of course Mandela did not die and, for his age remains surprisingly robust. However, the rumour persists that the plan is still in place, and that most blacks in the country are aware of that plan. I am told that when racial disputes occur, blacks often tell whites, "Wait until Mandela dies.” and they mean it
In the first part of this mini-series, I shared that with all sad things (like closing my dance studio) come great opportunities. It’s very true that something good comes from something bad or where one door closes, another opens. I’ve looked at this year as an opportunity to be away from running a busy business and taking the time, while I can, to better myself as a teacher for my students. I’ve already taken a great four day teacher training intensive with Ranya Renee up in Vancouver. She’s a wonderful Egyptian style belly dancer based in New York City. I have arranged plans to take a couple more belly dance intensives this year as well as attend my second Zumba Instructor Convention in Orlando. I can teach my Zumba classes without going of course, but it adds so much to my classes by learning more about different dance styles, energizing me about Zumba in general, and meeting other fellow instructors from around the world. This year, I’m VERY happy to say that I’m challenging myself and studying for the AFAA certification that is being held the day before the convention officially kicks off. AFAA is a group fitness certification, so it’s one of the best things I can do for my students. I’ll learn more about the body, how it works, nutrition, weight-loss, etc.
My College Play was barely born
Readers agreed more on who should play Harry than on any other question. When asked to choose between Andy Garcia, Johnny Depp, Sam Elliott, Tony Shahloub, and Humphrey Bogart, a whopping 75% of the responses identified SAM ELLIOTT as the actor they'd like to see portray Harry.
My cousin thinks he was shot to death for over-celebrating every tackle like he just won the super bowl. I don’t know how he lives with himself.
We knew we wouldn’t be pasturing these hens, so that meant an additional chore of bringing greens to them each day. The hens get our house compost, which consists of coffee grounds, peelings, anything the dogs don’t eat, and egg shells about every other day. Also they get anything from the garden that needs pulling, or culling. About once a week they get a wheelbarrow of stable cleanings. There are enzymes in manure that help the chickens digest their food, plus they find ”yummy” stuff in there too.

Port A, I think, is of two minds. It appears to want to embrace the beach tourism dollahs, and yet still keep its "sleepy fishing village" ethos. Generally, it's still a pretty charming place, and the growth, while evident, appears to be moving very slowly.
Just a few years ago, owning a flat screen TV was a point of differentiation for the most up to date households. “Look how thin it is,” elicited ooh-ahhs of admiration from neighbours and friends. Today, flat screens seem to be as commonplace as toasters and microwaves.
I have a feeling we'll be having a few more conversations like these over the next few years. Until then, I'll just do my best to prepare for the unexpected.

I said, “Not that way, he could catch us, see where we are as far as the park goes.”
We would either pick up Route 66 in Missouri or in Oklahoma, getting there either by a northern route through Illinois to St. Louis or a more southerly one, down to North Carolina and through the hills of Tennessee, accompanied by country music and fire-and-brimstone preachers on the radio. Sometimes we would be driving Andrew’s trusty old 1950 International Harvester milk truck whose maximum speed was 55 miles per hour, and at other times my first car, a 1966 Ford Falcon, with its “three-on-the-tree” gear stick on the steering column. In the 1970s, with gasoline prices ranging from 39 to 69 cents per gallon (even after the oil crisis of 1973), three people traveling together could drive across country and back for $40 to $70 each.
That being said, the fact that this blog post quoted this study as saying that the normal time it takes for people (but men, in particular) to fall in love and then express that verbally is 97 days, blew my mind.

My mum asked whether it would ever go away.. and I said no, but the truth is that I don’t want it to. When the only other option is to fall off the edge of the world, it pushes you to give everything to strive towards something better. When everything you’ve worked for is at risk, it puts everything in perspective for a while. And that’s what drives me. I used to say to myself that I would never be back there, but the truth it that I am back there regularly, just to remind myself, and I get a kick out of that somehow. It sends adrenaline soaring throughout your body and forces you to make a decision – live or die. Perhaps I should just take up extreme sports, it might be a bit safer… I guess before, I was just scared that if I was back there, the past would repeat itself but I trust myself more than ever to do the right thing. I’m glad that I have this spring that I can bounce against every time I feel uncertain or lost.
By the time C came home around 5-ish I was in tears, okay I was sobbing! I had just got done "yelling" (I could not yell but I did the best I could to let them know I was TICKED) at my kids telling them how terribly sick I was (for some reason they had not noticed at all) and that all I wanted for today was to feel better and that having children that would play nice and love each other would have helped me a ton. Yes, I laid on the guilt!!! They deserved it. Daddy walked in just after this conversation saw how awful I looked and heard about how awful they had been that day and then he began to make them feel guilty as well, like I said, they deserved it.
It is come to my mind that Malaysian political environment needs a lot more improvement, especially with current so called “dual party” system (even not so dual with uncertainties in Pakatan Rakyat). What happen in this dominant system is that the pro government will always support the government and talk bad about the opposition and so do to the opposition side will never accept any efforts made by the government.
Here’s the part I’m not too clear on, though – between these “primaries” and then the bigger “general election,” is every individual server going to have a different outcome as far as who the Warchief is going to be? Because it would be kind of weird story-wise if they don’t have one consistent leader across the whole game…but if it’s going to be standardized and preset, it kind of defeats the purpose of all these world events where it makes it seem like you get to have an effect on who ends up in charge.

The U.S., always the essential midwife to postwar European reconstruction, stability and prosperity, is turning inward in one of its most bitterly fought presidential contests in generations. Spain’s role as the second-largest foreign investor in Latin America after the U.S. has implications for American exports — just one small example of the bad news for the American economy as Europe’s troubles deepen.

My food arrived more quickly than it did on the Sunday morning. The reuben was served on a marble swirl bread and was stacked high with close to a pound of thinly sliced lean corned beef. The fries were perfectly crisp and piping hot and there was a small cup of cole slaw on the side.

When you watch a Keaton film you can always expect great comedy and great action. The comedy is split fairly evenly between broad physical humor and the subtler comedy of manners which arises from the way that Willie tries to finesse his situation so that he doesn't end up killed. The action comes fairly fast and furious, showcasing some truly amazing stunts by Keaton. In the climatic waterfall scene Keaton has to rescue Talmadge by swinging across the waterfall on a rope and catching her in midair as she goes over the fall. Being 1923, achieving the stunt involved actually doing it, making the scene endlessly impressive. The sense of danger is very real and the skill on the part of the crew, on-screen and off-screen, is apparent.
and this death could be an actual death and it could be the actual death of a dream and since our dreams are literally the stuff our future selves are created from - the death of a dream is huge
Work is about to start on improvements to the area leading to King John’s Palace and some archaeological works to the palace as part of the Ouseburn Park Heritage Lottery Bid. A suitable time, I thought, to gather together a few photos taken over the years before the area changes.
I don’t know what sort of shoes Moses was wearing. Maybe he had on a nice soft pair of Nike’s or some really comfortable Wolverine’s. All I know is that something happened after he arrived on the scene that day. Or maybe it had happened a week prior when Moses walked his sheep through that place. Whatever it was that happened, God told Moses to take off his shoes because the place where he was standing was sacred ground. And I think Moses had something to do with that.
By making such comments Naik is clearly guilty of shirk, or the sin of associating partners with Allah, for ascribing some of Allah’s names and attributes to true prophets like Moses and also to the false prophet Muhammad, thereby elevating them to the level of divinity.

Why a known-mobster like De Pedis is buried on the grounds of a Vatican church has been the object of much speculation since 1997, when a church maid revealed the tomb’s existence to an inquisitive journalist. The Vatican was always cagey about why the mobster was buried in one of its churches, and ultimately, the church’s silence spurred countless conspiracy theories. Now, thanks to shocking Vatican letters leaked in the Vatileaks scandal that is rocking the Holy See, the Italian police are less interested in why he’s buried there. Instead, they want to open the tomb to see if the remains of 15-year-old Emanuela Orlandi are interred with those of the mobster.And this:

It did rain pretty heavily one day on the trip. We stuck it out (in the park) until a little after noon time. At that point, our feet were soggy and our toddlers' hands were cold. We shuffled back to the rental house and enjoyed our evening inside.
It's amazing what all can be done with a little thread and some ingenuity
One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn’t matter. Just like it didn’t matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates – a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.
Marketing - most people we talked to at the event were just as confused as we were, as to what would be included with the price of the admission ticket. Based on event communications, we thought for the high price of admission, there would be plenty of food - with the majority of booths offering free samples, and select vendors offering food for purchase. We arrived at around 1:30pm and were extremely disappointed to find that there were only maybe 8-9 vendors that actually offered free food (bite-sized samples of Voskos greek yogurt, Kyocho fried chicken, korean pancake, calamari from Tantalum, La Brea Bakery bread and Kerrygold cheese, cake balls, curry and thai pancake, strawberry buttermilk gelato). Though we shamelessly went several rounds at each of these booths, it was definitely not enough to be filling.

We really struggled to find nice places to eat in Naples. There are many, many hole in the wall pizza places which are great for a quick bite but in the evening it's nice to sit and take your time. I had a list of restaurants I'd found recommended and so the first evening we went in search of one. I put the address into the maps app on my phone and off we went. We went backwards and forwards past the flashing blue dot on the map but there was no corresponding restaurant door. The only time we successfully found a recommended restaurant was when we phoned and made a reservation and then got a taxi to take us there. Weird.

As parents, a lot of us want our kids to win at all costs. We want to relive our glory days (or lack thereof) through our children. That’s why this country is filled with crazy little league parents (I used to be one of the crazy little league parents). My son’s little league coach actually got into a physical fight with an umpire (during the game) a few years ago. But to me, that’s not what sports are all about. At this point in my life, I’ve decided playing sports is not about winning championships. With the exception of a VERY few exceptional athletes who go on to play collegiate or professional sports, most athletes will play sports only through high school. For the majority of athletes, sports are meant to teach us how to be better adults. They teach us how to take orders from an authority figure like a boss. Playing sports also teaches us how to work together as part of a team with people that we may not normally want to work with. Finally, after this last weekend, I learned that playing sports also helps us learn how to deal with winning, and losing, in a better way. This weekend was full of disspointing March Madness losses in my home. But it’s okay because I know that athletics are going to strengthen their character and prepare them for adulthood.

Spiritual conflict has been a part of human experience from that time on. Genesis 3:15 provides a key element in establishing the context in which all the rest of the Bible must be viewed:

Deb isn’t just theorizing when she gives hope and practical solutions to those who struggle with difficult relationships. Her own brokenness has given her great compassion and insight for others who are hurting. With her vibrant and engaging manner, she speaks profoundly about God’s faithfulness and how to embrace a God-honoring life in the midst of almost unbearable circumstances. Deb and Randy are grateful beyond words for their 39 years of “not-so-perfect” marriage.

Brian Nash is a tennis-obsessed, college senior who's unlucky in love and the roommate and best friend of Jillian's son, Rob. When Rob brings Brian home for spring break and he meets the surprisingly young and also tennis passionate Jillian, their shared interest quickly develops into an intense mutual attraction. After nearly giving in to their feelings, they hatch a plan, while under the influence (of something more than just the perfect Miami night), to be Friends With Partial Benefits complete with rules to define the boundaries.

Jack looks down at me, for what seems like the longest second ever all movement stops. There is a little flicker in his eyes and for a second I see the man I fell in love with.

Inside, there was not much more affection for Hodg son. The tabloid’s chief sports writer, Steven Howard, was distinctly underwhelmed by Hodgson’s opening press conference and hinted heavily that his preferred choice for the job was someone else: “It wasn’t the all-singing, all-dancing debut we might have expected from Harry Redknapp with journalists rolling around in the aisles and the men who might have appointed him but didn’t slapping each other on the back and thinking: ‘He’s got them eating out of his hand already.’”
Andy is Australian. He was born in Australia, his name in Andy. He also has a Vietnamese name (Anh) and can speak and understand some Vietnamese (he calls it Vietlish).

Of course, the “choice” offered is not nearly so extreme as Hobbes’ choice, but is nevertheless a choice that is badly skewed by the costs attached to some options, then it does not improve choices.
In a predominantly secular society which has seen the need to go to church diminish over time, it is clearly no longer viable for the church-goers themselves to foot the bill for maintaining their antique buildings. They are too few. Ironically, with this as a background I am aware that splinter groups continue to form, insisting that they are Christian but want to worship in their own (not Cof E) way. One such has opened a new church in what used to be a corporate social club on the outskirts of Cheltenham. They have done so with a view to the "church" building serving as a general community centre when not being used for worship. I've no idea whether this will work, but it does seem more positive than watching your debts grow while praying for a subsidy or a generous patron.

The NPA is without a doubt the most committed and coherent revolutionary party in France, and undoubtedly the one I would have voted for if I had a vote in France. It's failure to stand up against racism on that occasion reflects how deeply racism is rooted in French political culture as a whole.

So, why all the fuss? And how did this relatively benign group merit a headline like this in the Huffington Post: “Truth4Time, Secret Religious Right Facebook Group, Included NOM Co-Founder, Fox News Pundit And More”? (To the credit of the editor in the Huffpost HATER/Fag Voices section, he responded to Michel Brown immediately when he raised concerns about the factual content of the article, he was courteous and helpful from first to last, and he posted Michael Brown corrections within the text of the article itself.)

Although I’m friends with both types of authors, I have to say I’m a little bit of both. Depending on the length of the work that I’m writing, I can decide if I can just wing it or I need a plan.
He slowly sits straight up and glances at the date on his desk calendar, Friday October 14, 2004. He gazes out his fourth floor office window toward the protective sloping mountains where the soft edges of the early evening sun accentuates the reds and deep yellows of lingering foliage and begin the casting of long deep shadows. He stands and watches as the soft dark gray hue wraps its arms around the trees. Perfect for hiking. Going to be unusually chilly the next three days; we’ll need heavy jackets. Try out my new tent, he thought as he looks down at the sprawling Macolm State Facility. I’ve wasted my time here trying to help these hopelessly deranged fragmented human shells. Frustrating, their only desire is freedom. He glances up at a squint eyed surveillance camera protruding slightly from his ceiling. Wonder if a stretch of tape would be noticed. I’ll do it…, on my last day.
My wife went with the scrambled eggs with black truffle and toasted baguette (pictured at the top of this post). I tried some of her entree, and it was great. The eggs were a really simple preparation (creamy, almost “soupy” French-style scrambled eggs) with undertones of truffle. The simplicity of the dish really allowed the truffle to come through, and the creamy eggs went well with the crunchy toasted baguette. I definitely had some entree envy.

Dear Raegan,
On the outside of another exit from Fraggle Rock, through a well, live a family of Gorgs, giant furry humanoids standing 22 feet tall. The husband and wife of the family call themselves the King and Queen of the Universe, with their son Junior as its Prince and their heir, but to all appearances working as simple farmers with a hut and garden patch. The Gorgs regard Fraggles as pests, which steal radishes from their garden. In one episode it is revealed that the Gorgs use radishes to make "anti-vanishing cream" that prevents them from becoming invisible. So the three main races of the Fraggle Rock universe — Fraggles, Doozers and Gorgs — are all dependent on the radishes for different reasons. While the King and Queen consider the Fraggles disgusting vermin, Junior enjoys chasing, catching and keeping them like a boy would lizards and bugs. Junior has no friends, and perhaps pursues the Fraggles just so he has someone to talk to.
The only info I was given for my chosen category, 'Domestic', was a choice of the following:

One thing I found was that Romanians love dogs (OK not all of them, just the ones with dogs!!!) and when I was walking with Golden I would see a neighbor or someone I didn’t know in the street and they would walk up to me with a beaming smile…. Walk past me, totally ignoring me and then hug our beagle and start speaking to him. It actually did make feel a bit insecure when people would rather speak to my dog instead of me. In fact most people would know Golden’s name but not mine. During the doggy walk people would walk past and say “Ce faci Golden”? Although expecting him to reply “bine”

Being “subconsciously” racist is always a hard one to avoid and leads to all sorts of dire results, such as the fabled “institutional racism”, most frequently demonstrated by irrational acts, such as the police arresting disproportionate numbers of black boys for no better reason that that they commit disproportionate numbers of crimes.

Zinc also promotes a healthy immune system and helps in the healing of wounds, to top it off. A healthy immune system also lends a hand to preventing acne and Zinc helps to maintain that healthy immune system in a variety of ways. This is just icing on the cake for those who decide to take Zinc to help with their acne since taking Zinc will also make their immune systems that much healthier and perform that much better.

I felt a little panicked, worried that I still had the shoulders in and had a shoulder dystocia. I guess I was just expecting to have the baby pulled out the rest of the way, the way we do in the OB-world. But they were just waiting for another push from me. So I did, and then he was here.

I love tucking all the kids in bed, saying goodnight to my husband, and then withdrawing into my writing bubble until I just can’t keep my eyes open any more. I used to be able to stay up until 1 or 2am, but now that I’m older, I can barely make it past eleven. I tend to fall asleep sitting up in my chair with my fingers still on the keyboard.
I thought it looked so cheerful
The other day when I was loading all three of my kids into their car seats (which miraculously do all fit into the back of our car) I got thinking about how nice it must have been back in the days when they didn't have car seats. No straps to fuss with, not belts to untangle-- just throw the kids in and go! But then I started thinking more about it and realized that not having car seats or seat belts would mean that the kids could, and would, wander, jump and crawl all over the car. How did people drive with chaos like that going on? And what did they use to do with infants? Just lay them on the seat and hope they didn't roll off? Really, how in the world did our grandmothers manage riding in cars without car seats?
"India pale ale was invented by George Hodgson, a brewer at the Bow Brewery in East London in the 1790s, who took his pale ale recipe, increased the hop content considerably, and raised the alcohol content by adding extra grain and sugar.

Josh Grant's puritan upbringing by Amish grandparents did not prepare him for life as a city cop. It did prepare him to live as a reclusive farmer in the mountains of Southern Idaho where he relocated. The lifestyle served as his personal pergatory to atone for his self-imposed guilt for not protecting his wife and son from the drug ravaged city crime. His isolated hideaway, where the only responsibility was to his animals, served as santuary for a while.

None of those people gave a damn. And their information was crucial to what I was trying to do, and it's not like I can go anywhere else for a liquor licence or for the information.

NHS is currently suing Reckitt Benckiser for £90 million following an investigation that ruled the company had abused its dominant position in the heartburn market.

It has long been a question, ” What is the line between art and pornography?” I use to believe there was indeed a line between the two. Erotic art for instance, can go so far as to push the envelope of sexuality, while still remaining balanced on the other side of “Smut“. But as of late, I have been reconsidering.

9:14 James Carville is speaking on CNN. I am suddenly ill. David Gergen is rightly criticizing the structure of the “show” as not understanding how to grab the audience. He’s rightfully critical about Jim Leach’s speech as being boring and losing the audience signing on at the top of the hour.
These are the types of sketches you need to be practicing when you are doodling, these basic drawing techniques. Think of a action like holding a phone and try and draw it on your note pad. Think how you might draw a gesture such as waving, or pointing, action arrows help a lot in capturing motion. Study how others draw storyboards. I find that thinking about people as Lego figures helps, I always find that these simple characters can capture a whole host of interactions just by playing with poses and making a small additions to what they hold and how their faces look. People don’t get represented much simpler than this, plus if you use the real Lego’s you can practice drawing what you see.
I have had dreams die. I have made mistakes. People have let me down. I have let people down, I have said many things that I regret. Dwelling on the past is like wrapping a noose around your neck and trying to walk forward. You can’t move forward, you will only choke. God doesn’t want this for me. He doesn’t want me bearing the weight of the past. Forgetting is much harder to do than even forgiving. Most often in my life, the hardest person to forgive is myself. Oh, how I want to go over old history and pick myself apart! No, God clearly says, be alert, be present. Today. This is all I have. Is my mind focused on the tasks at hand or am I drowning in a sea of past regrets and memories?
How to write this crime novel that has been floating in my head for more than a year has given me some trouble and following it to nowhere is not helping a lot.
My first recipe that I prepared from this book was her Italian cheesecake. I prepared it as my dessert for Christmas and no one was disappointed. I have a fabulous recipe that I have made for years but I really do like this recipe and it may very well become my new favorite.
I have another concept in mind, one that is by no means novel or unique, but which is sufficiently counter-intuitive (for us, at least) to merit fresh consideration.
Ever since that crucial insight I thought of the book as half ghost story, half crime novel. After the more mystical mysterious magical happenings of Waking Dream and Bad Blood, I wanted to write a book where the supernatural elements ran in tandem with a physical action plot.
My thoughts immediately snowballed from there as I pondered the possibility of me having secondary infertility. I’ve been through fear and sadness but also have had peace. Looking back at how clearly God’s plan for Ella was has brought me immense amounts of peace. It is a great reminder for me that God has a plan!!! He had a plan. That was all part of His plan and this is all part of His plan.

We spoke of the highs and lows of a mood disorder and all that jazz but we also spoke of the great Spirituality behind this particular mental illness. We spoke of our preferred moods (while there is no control of these swings, some are easier to handle than others) at which time I told her that Depression was much easier on me than Mania. She turned her head and looked at me so deeply I could feel her eyes tickle my soul. My view of Depression is a completely different animal than hers. As far as Mania.....the supposed better part of the disorder.....I hate that shit more than a Republican.
She brings to me such miracles,
We all do this from time to time. Even when you’re older chronologically, there are still life experiences which place you in a young mindset or situation. We should look for the beauty and love along every path we travel, through every journey we take, over every mountain we climb. If we become too focused on an end result or a goal, we miss so many wonderful experiences along the way.
My mother gave me a very special gift today, she gave me my grandmother's engagement ring. Still in it's original box from Ritter's Jewellers and Watchmakers, Port Elizabeth & Grahamstown.
I guess it really is about the simple things. The moments that catch me off guard and I laugh out of real delight over something. Like the way Grandma can brighten my day playing cards or the comfortable feeling of being right where I'm supposed to be.

Elterwater is only 20 minutes’ drive from Blenheim Lodge, and one meanders through some pretty countryside lanes to get there. As one enters the walk to the lake, there is a little bridge, to the side of which is some rough water. We enjoyed seeing people trying to paddle up the little rapids. I have to admit, though, that I would not have wanted to try it myself as it looked very very cold and wet!

While any cracker would work for this, the sweet lemony flavor of the Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins with the tart cranberry and creamy brie are an amazingly wonderful combination. These cookie thins also come in a gingerbread flavor, which I'd like to try with the cranberries, too. Wonder if it would be as good? I'll have to find out!
When the Lord spoke against this in John 2:16, they hated Him for it. He said, “Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.” In the same manner Paul’s preaching inEphesushad the same effect. In Acts19:19the believers were convicted of their religious practises, “brought their books together and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.” That is the equivalent of about 7 million dollars.

So I was surprised to find a little reminder of Olde New York inside the Times Square branch. I sat down with my Bird Dog and fries and saw this message burned into the long table: "Handcrafted in Brooklyn, NY, this surface was once part of a bowling late." No wonder the wood glows a bit. The tables are made by the DUMBO company CounterEvolution. There are apparently more bowling-lane tables in the Brooklyn restaurant. Where, I wonder, was the lane? What neighborhood?
I kept wondering if the old Paula, my Paula was in there. And if she was, could I somehow bring her out. Maybe if I told her a story about us, or about one of the many good deeds she'd done for me over the years, that would spark her into the moment for a few seconds.
much thanks to crooks and liars for this story

I absolutely cannot stop raving about the card base cardstock that I have recently discovered at CutCardstock. I know it is something we really don't "see" in our creations, but let me tell you how sturdy it is and how easy it folds and creases. The metallic iridescence is beautiful. No more cards bending under the weight of the embellishments and no more "crack" when I score my card base. Check out the link to the cardstock I use here. Design Paper is from Cart-Us - "Wedding" 6x6 pad. Flowers and metal embellishments from WOC.

I sat on the edge of my seat watching the odometer and wondering how far he would drive before turning around. About seven or eight kilometers up the road we approached another station, yet it had no lights lit – it was closed. Again, anxiety started to rise. However with the wave of a hand and a smile the driver said that we would try for another station.
The ad industry grew up, the marketing industry grew up, our creative people grew up, and our clients grew up. We came to understand that advertising's power was limited and contingent. We came to understand that a lot of advertising was wasteful and inefficient. We learned that television was not a miracle and advertising was not magic.

Several days later his friend Al, who runs Al's diner, calls him to tell him an unbelieveable secret. Inside his storage room is a portal to 1958. Jake thinks Al is joking until he goes through the "rabbit hole" and finds himself back in 1958. Returning back to 2011 he finds that Al has told him about the portal for a single reason; he wants Jake to go back and save the life of President John F. Kennedy.

So my advice during this extremely wet period of drought, yes the hosepipe ban still stand for this area, is to avoid riding Wakerley Wood for your own sanity and also for the good of the trail. I’m heading down that way myself tomorrow evening but you can be sure that I’ll be sticking to the weatherproof surfaces of Fineshade rather than churning up the Wakerley Mud.
Julien stood silent. The night wind touched his face; the hills were shadows on the horizon where they blotted out the stars. Suddenly he felt how large the world was, how huge the night, how small they stood on the road in the light of the waning moon. Ahead, the road bent into the pine woods, and in his mind, Julien saw Benjamin walking away, a small form carrying a suitcase into the darkness under the trees. His fingers bit into Benjamin’s arm.
Being a big fan of aubergine, the baingan was a big hit. Smokey and delicately spiced with a luxurious texture that was so so pleasing to eat, I loved it. And the pigeon was a nice surprise too as I've never had game presented like this before. Very tender and again light with aromatic spice flavours rather than the fiery heat I normally associate with curries, mind you Uncle Ji did criticise the English interpretation that Indian food should be packed with chillies. The homemade paneer was very good too, rich and creamy whereas the rice was plain and simple and all the better for it given the combinations of flavours going on. There was one duff note though I am afraid which was the dhal chutney, compared to the rest of the plate it was rather bland and felt like it needed something else for some extra oomph. I normally love coriander but the last minute addition to this chutney left it all tasting rather.....soapy? Sorry Uncle Ji but otherwise, a splendid meal.

Thank YOU for sharing your work, yourself, your soul (that’s poems for you!) I have had a great month, reading folks I generally follow and an unexpected and fabulous flourish of new folk.
Two Saturdays ago, I went and visited my Grandpa in the rehab center that he has been staying at for almost a month now. I am so grateful that I went and visited him. I can't begin to tell you how great it was to talk to him and have an hour or so alone-one on one. I talked to him about newly married life. How I really live in the country now and how I love it. We talked about our chickens and ducks and showed him pictures of them. We also talked about how me and my siblings swam in the pool and played in the field at his house with our cousins. I had some of the best times at his house. I told him I always had a good time when I visited. I think it made him feel good to hear that.
For those who are interested, 'Tango Man' is now being critiqued under the Romantic Novelists Association New Writers Scheme. And hey, I’ve written a blog. Think of all the positives. It’s only taken me five months. Surely, I won’t have long to wait for some news from my Consultant. We’re hoping August for the surgery. It doesn’t seem that far away now. Maybe this is the beginning of the great fight back. I’m known for them, but then again...

But when it comes time to use that original amount of money for the project of which it was intended months or years later, the capital gains (profits) of that supposedly dormant money are separated from the original amount placed into the “holding account” and stay in the governments discretionary investment coffers and are then reinvested not for the benefit of the people, but for the wealth and profit of the corporate government. The problem and the inherent crime here is this – that profit is no longer considered tax-payer (public) owned money, since it was earned by investment or by accrued interest. That “extra money” goes elsewhere… mainly into other investments or funds which grease the pockets of the “in the know” politicians and corporations and other people and groups involved. Some open what are called “self insurance funds” and then draw dividends for themselves and their fellow conspirators for the rest of their political careers by insuring themselves with their own insurance funds. And the cycle goes on and on and on and on… and has for the last 70 years. And it has now reached the point where government owns it all!
I germinated and replanted over a few days week before last and have sprouts already coming up. Beans, okra and lettuce and I already hit them fuckers with Sevin insecticide. I also dusted all the peppers, melons and cukes then hit the tomatoes last. I really hated to do the tomatoes because there were a bunch of ladybugs in there doing a job on the aphids, but they just weren't cutting it.

In all seriousness, a clean house and a peaceful grocery shop isn't enough to keep me home. It's the entire package. It's our quality of life. We used to spend our weekends driving from errand to errand, then rushing home to make sure the boy got a good nap. We used to have a rule that we couldn't schedule more than one thing each weekend because it just became too much. We broke that rule all the time and spent many months just plain tired. Now we get to go do things as a family. We are enjoying our life.

I find this study interesting in light of several conversations I have had in the past with others. When I have discussed my lack of faith in organized religion (while remaining open-minded, though skeptical about the possibility of a deity), religious people always ask me how I can know the difference between right and wrong. I find this to be a ridiculous question, but convicted believers truly doubt that a person such as I could be guided by moral principles without relying on the Bible to tell me what those principles are.
Unfortunately, it leaves you hanging a little. I guess that’s because they’re coming up with another movie next November.

4Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:
Quite frankly, the Meanies wouldn't have sounded like the Meanies without the existence of a certain quartet of "brothers" hailing from Queens, NY. By the time these singles came out at the dawn of the Clinton-era, they were outdoing Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee in colossal fashion, all while those three gents were still walking the Earth. In fact, some of the Meanies compositions rivaled the heaviness of the Ramones circa Leave Home. At one point during their '90s tenure, the Meanies featured two guitarists, which might account for their barreling, sonic blitzkrieg. Mouthpiece Link Meanie is the heart and soul of the group, possessing just the right set of lungs for punk rock this visceral and voracious. Sadly, in 2008 the Meanies tale was becoming shrouded in tragedy, with the separate passings of guitarists Tas and DD.

Best thing about being a writer is freedom to express yourself once you’ve got a character up and running and finding that it’s caught fire with the reader. And when you’re writing a novel, you sit down and look at the blank page of the next chapter and it feels as though these characters you’ve created are waiting to see what they’re going to do next. My characters are very real to me and I love living with them! I don’t have a worst thing about being a writer. I love everything about it, because creating characters and storylines is what makes me tick. I’d have nowhere to go in my life if I didn’t write. Sad, but true!

I’ve come to my passion late in life. It was always there in the periphery, in the secret wishes that I didn’t share with anyone else. I wasn’t ready. I didn’t have what I needed to move forward. Now I do, and someday, woman we shouldn’t have laughed at, you will too. Be patient. It’s worth it.

One thing to bear in mind here, I think, is that although the Bond novels are obviously a series, they're also designed to be standalone, and lean much more towards the latter design than the former. You can pick up any Bond book and dive in, with no knowledge of previous books required. Historically, particularly in the years before the internet made finding out in which order to read books in a series a hell of a lot easier, that's almost certainly the way they were read – bought at random, devoured equally haphazardly. In which light, Bond's romancing of a different woman in each book perhaps isn't so objectionable: for many readers, there wouldn't have been a previous book to compare it to.

I always prefer organic vegetables when available and if they are local, even better. If the potatoes are organic, I tend to leave the skins on. Even for the yams, although not for this recipe. Carrots I tend to peel as it reveals the beautiful color underneath. I have not come across organic parsnips too often, but nevertheless I would probably peel them as well. The same would apply for the pear.

Here, we are going to talk about one of the biggest news events in the weather category that has been covered by several reporters and news stations earlier this week. Hurricane Irene made landfall last weekend effecting most of the East Coast of the US, killing 43 people, leaving 5 -6 million people without power and pouring several feet of rain across America. The most terrifying part of Hurricane Irene wasn’t the 65 + miles per winds, it was the floods and rushing waters that did the most damage to the East Coast. Bridges also tumbled down stranding due to the rising waters, leaving thousands of residents stranded. The cost of restoration post Irene is said to be in the billions.
Some wonderfully heartening - and most unexpected - news announced this morning: The Lantern has been shortlisted in the Epic Romantic Novel category for the Romantic Novelists' Association's 2012 Awards. It's up against some very strong competition so I've not a crumb of expectation of this going any further, but just as it is, this is just the spur to the confidence I needed.

So much has happened since I last wrote here in May, there'd be no way I could recap all that took place, and it's almost too much to even summarize the highlights. But in a nutshell: God is good. Even when life is hard, God is good. That's the one constant, always, no matter what. God is good....
Reduce heat to medium. Add onion, bell peppers, and garlic to pan; cook 7 minutes or until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in olives and next 5 ingredients (through black pepper); cook 30 seconds or until fragrant. Stir in vinegar, scraping pan to loosen browned bits; cook for 2 minutes or until liquid almost evaporates. Stir in broth, tomato paste, and bay leaves. Add steaks; bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat, and cook 1 1/2 hours or until steaks are very tender. Discard bay leaves.

You may ask why did she do it? Well, she felt prompted to do it. And I'm so glad she did! She didn't want any recognition for it. She asked if I posted not to mention her name. (that's why I didn't post the card just in case someone knew she had made that card, but trust me it's so pretty!)

At this point Price headed off to the reception room and collected a 1978 first edition – in a yellow dustjacket, of course – of Sheila Hodges's Gollancz: The Story of a Publishing House 1928–1978, which he handed to me opened at a passage quoting himself, before heading off for more wine. The quote runs thus:
This is a new show to me, but I am pleased to put it on this list thanks to a really quality first season. Of course things started off a little rocky as the show tried to figure out what worked and didn’t. Fortunately they avoided spending too much time at the high school after a silly football tryout episode and instead focused more on interesting plot lines. The human vs. vampire and Salvatore brothers vs. other vampire stories that rooted back into the history of Mystic Falls was far more compelling than rehashing the high school material that Buffy already covered. The cast was smartly selected, with Ian Somerhalder getting the juicy role of Damon. He’s delivering both the humor, but also the conflict between having the instincts predator, albeit with a human conscience. It really is a breakout role for him as he can nail the funny scenes, be charming, play deep emotion and get a little scary too. The show leans a little heavy towards proclamations of love, but thanks to the depictions of pain that is brought by living amongst vampires, it is more than enough to stomach the teen romance. I guess it is just a wonder to me why any show on The CW would strive so hard to make a quality show, but at some point I just need to stop asking those questions and just sit back and enjoy the fact that they are.

The nose on this is really sweet and caramelly. The palate is sweet and woody with a fair amount of acid. The finish is sweet bourbon. I have had a number of bottles of Weller Centennial, both Stitzel-Weller and Buffalo Trace, which were excellent, but this one doesn't quite live up to those.

My first grade students gathered around me for story time. They all got comfortable on the rug as I made myself comfortable in the old, dilapidated chair which held the honor of being known as our reader's chair. I waited until everyone had settled down and then began reading. All eyes were on the pictures as I read with expression and a variety of voices. You could have heard a pin drop as all eyes and ears followed the story. And then out of nowhere a little voice spoke up and said, "Mrs. Kelley, what do you say?!"
Verify the Verse:
Lucien, when he's with Vancouver Son, goes insane. I can't say it was the most relaxing evening for Alex or me because we had to keep jumping up to pull Lucien off the curtains, or out of the china cabinet, or off the roof of the building. Virginia Mom and Dad, who have two quieter and calmer girls, sat at the table and got drunk while the rest of us dealt with the chaos of boys.
Here you can see some of the contents of the box. That thing with an old fashioned telephone dial is a neat phone number file. You dial the first letter of the name of the person you want to call and the thing opens to that page.
My husband and I have known good times and sorrowful times. Challenging times and peaceful times. Our bodies have changed as grey hairs have woven themselves into a life that no longer holds the promise of youth. We have been lucky to share a philosophical view of life, allowing us to marvel at an ever-expanding universe. At times I feel like we are tiny specs of star-dust in the dark night. At times, rays of light from a glorious sun. We have shared our wounds, our hearts, our minds and a wicked sense of humor that in spite of anything and everything keeps us laughing through the ups and downs, the thick and thin. Always in the context of the covenant that we will love and care for one another. Always in the context of holding hands.
In October 2009, women comprised 49.99% of the workforce, a breath of a hair of an itty bitty thread away from being half of Americans in the workforce. Part of this illusory equality was brought on by the gendered nature of the industries overwhelmingly affected by the recession in the first place. As the recession plodded along, the jobs in traditionally male industries like construction didn’t return, and unemployment benefits started to run out. And we now appear to be moving away from gender parity once again; threatened with impending expiration of any form of aid or income, some men did the unthinkable— debase themselves enough to work women’s jobs like- gasp!- retail.

I poured over my copy of Cliffs Notes, saw Spacey discuss the production on Charlie Rose, read every available page on Wikipedia and watched Pacino’s Looking for Richard. I find it all a bit hard to grasp, although I felt somewhat vindicated by the Pacino documentary. Early on, while trying to summarize the story, he loses his train of thought and says it’s no wonder people are put off by it.
For Nietzsche then the ‘slave-morality’ has distorted our view of what is truly ‘good’ (praise-worthy in the Classical sense) and the ressentiment of the slaves has distorted their masters into ‘evil’.
The Homecoming Parade was way fun. But the events following are what's really left in my memory roladex file.
Women are first mentioned in the Bible in Genesis 1:26-28:
I love the holidays. I love Christmas, and even all the preparation. Putting up a tree, decorating, making cookies, buying gifts....I love it all! But it sure does make our family busy.

By the way, it was while filming at the Dakota that Mia's husband Frank Sinatra served her divorce papers. Tacky.
April 21st.. I think it was about 21:30 when we drove off from ’s Hertogenbosch. The weather was terrible and while we were driving (unfortunately I was the designated driver) with a group of friends, I noticed how badly I need glasses in the car.. I couldn’t see a thing, which made the hour and a halve trip to Hasselt a bit more exciting for all of us. We arrived at the spot and parked our cars. While the rest went to the entrance, Thomas and I walked to the crew entrance.
At a time when this country was facing serious domestic and international problems Blair and his wretched government set off in pursuit of a fox. Rather, they set off in pursuit of fox hunters, determined in a mood of urban spite to stop hunting with hounds, to end an ancient rural custom. I don’t imagine one in ten Labour MPs gave a damn about the welfare of the fox. They were like the seventeenth century puritans who, as T. B. Macaulay said, hated bear baiting, not because it gave pain to the bears, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.
Firstly, a template was made from 3mm ply for the helix segments. As my helix is only single track compared to double track in the article, I made my segments 90mm wide. I also made my segments as one-eighth of a circle to maximise what I could fit on an 8’ x 4’ sheet of 6mm ply with minimum waste. The helix requires 80 of these segments, 16 per level. As mentioned in the article, these get laminated together to form a roadbed of 12mm thickness which should be very strong and not require any splice plates. Splice plates have the disadvantage of reducing the clearance between levels.

Alexander still stared when she stalked towards him, transfixed by the sky-blue of her eyes, noticing the knife in her hands only because its blade had the same dangerous glint. Even her dress was blue, although now stained with dark spots of water. And yet, he never hand seen something more beautiful. Never mind her angry glare, the threateningly raised weapon or her rather dishevelled and untidy state. Had Alexander been old enough, he would have known that he was about to fall in love.
I'm still processing what this means, but it's put the scare in me.

First of all, this may have been the best episode of The Office ever!
Elspeth is woken by the door of her room crashing open, and having a girl younger then herself try to tell her that she is here to ‘warn her’, but it is obvious that the poor girl cannot ‘think straight’ and has trouble expressing her thoughts. She has obviously had some sort of trauma or mental illness, judging by her erratic behaviour. Using her mental abilities, Elspeth was able to connect with the girl’s mind and found out her name was Selmar. Elspeth could tell that her mind was basically destroyed, from some incident, which makes me wonder what happened to her. The scene is made worse with the arrival of a ‘girlish’ young boy, who seems to torment and ridicule Selmar, whose reaction to his arrival is one of fear. He acts like he has authority, when he is probably only 11 or 12. He is a devilish, cunning and malicious boy. He is someone I will have no trouble hating.

On another front, I was away in Las Vegas for a week attending a family wedding and left my son to tend the garden in my absence. After about five or six days he decided to peek inside the cucumber bush to see if anything was ready for picking. At right you can see his one day harvest. When I first bought the cucumber plant, its tag said the mature fruit would be about six inches long. The tape measure along the bottom of the photo tells you these cukes are a lot bigger than six inches and these aren't even the largest ones that have been picked. I picked one that measured 11 inches long and another that was 9 inches long. The largest was nearly as thick as my arm. The one in the picture at left was as long as my forearm and they are all sugar sweet. The tomatoes pictured are only a fraction of what's still on the vine and the size of what's to come is enormous. I've been eating fresh cukes and tomatoes on a daily basis and loving every bite. I only fertilize when I first plant so I can't say that I'm doing anything particularly special to get such outstanding results. I'm beginning to think my earthworms are pooping steroids into the garden.

We've had a run of head injuries lately. I've kind of lost count but I think we might be up to 8 in the last three weeks. I can't remember what caused them all but I can remember the locations of the bruises so working from that the tally sits at 3 for Dragon and 5 for Monkey... Lion has got off easily in this little competition!
You see, this little guy decided today was the best day to be born...and why not, it is called mother's day for a reason.
In the end, I think a great deal of life depends on the consumption (and thus destruction… and thus suffering) of other life.
However, as for life being an illusion, both that man and the bird may be the same.

Start the sauce by combining the tomato puree, tomato paste, onion, pepper, garlic, sugar, salt and oregano, either in a large pot on the stove or in your slow cooker. Add one 24-oz can full of water. Heat on medium on the stove, or turn your slow cooker on to high.
Emmaline doesn't give a shit that we're sick! She's not really empathetic or understanding yet so I'm dealing as best I can. Emma still expects me to be on my A-Game. Lots of smiles, throws up in the air, stories, crawling around on the floor together, supporting her hands as she practices walking (yes, we're doing that now!), and basically pretending I'm NOT feeling like crap is how things have been going.
Greggin Stouthart walked into the Library. He’d checked every tavern, pub and watering hole along his route to the Guild Hall. He was an orderly man. Elderly, firm, and distinguished by his intense bushy brow and beard, thin lips and fiery demeanor. Mr. Stouthart was in fact searching for Ishcandar, his wild and wayward student. Mr. Stouthart had been Ischcandar’s tutor since he was young, and so he knew the lad quite well. “He’s a good upstanding Hobbit, at heart… deep deep deep deep down somewhere inside,” he used to think to himself. Yet, the idea that Ishcandar had landed up on a bar stool was all too familiar a one. Having not found him in such a wise was in fact a bit of a surprise to him.

4. Kinda Tortilla Soup. Heat 1 cup broth. Add the juice from a lime wedge and a few drops of hot sauce. Tear up two tortillas and add to the broth. Any leftover cooked vegetables or frozen vegetables like carrots, spinach, or onions may be added. Heat until boiling. Top with grated cheese, chopping scallions, pieces of chicken, and/or cooked shrimp. This is definitely the best way to use stale, dry tortillas.

St. Louis is by far the best mid-western city for celebrating St. Patrick’s Day. To start, Michelob sponsors a 5 mile run on the 14th. There is then a huge St. Patrick’s Day parade in downtown St. Louis, featuring character balloons, Irish dancers, equestrians and large floats.

Secondly, and this is the part that gained most of the media attention, the whole getting sacked employees to train their new replacements is kind of stinge. Imagine it, seriously, having to regurgitate years of knowledge, spending hours with your usurper buzzing around you like a fly, asking questions and taking notes, in full knowledge that Westpac have not only pushed you off the plank. They’re making you dig your own grave… The folks apparently don’t like it so much. I can’t imagine why.

In his statement, Mr Griffin said that to continue fighting the commission would bleed the party dry. He claimed that it would cost more than £1million to appeal and said would strip the party of the ability to fight the next general election. He appeared resigned to losing the case, saying that it was a matter of “evolving and living to fight another day or going down in a blaze of glory”.
Don’t make this job harder on yourself than it already is. If you’re going to query 500 agents at once then be ready to submit partials to 500 agents. If you only want to submit to 2, 5, or 10 at a time, that’s fine. It’s your choice. But then you should only query 2, 5, or 10 at a time.

We thank you for the land You have blessed us with, and ask only that, if it is Your will, You would continue to protect our homes in the future. Thank you for the food that we are about to eat, and for the hands that made it. Amen.”
On more than one occasion he threatened to make my life miserable if I divorced him and he is doing his very best to make that a reality. He even commented when I told him that I wanted a divorce that he did not understand why I felt the need to secure an attorney… I am thankful every day for that decision. I secured an attorney because I had years of experience with his attitudes and behaviors and knew that he would do exactly what he is doing today.

Of course fueling anti-Iranian sentiments has been constantly on the UAE officials’ political agenda. The statesmen of the newborn, tiny Arab sheikhdom think that by launching verbal attacks against Iran, they can gain power and popularity. But they have brought their eggs to the wrong market. Hostility and rivaling with Iran will backfire and fail. The hullabaloo of the Emirati officials is a tempest in a teapot and there’s no trace of logic and rationality in it. What is annoying and painful is that by credulously neglecting the principle of peaceful neighborhood and coexistence, the Arab officials are muttering the words of Israel, the U.S. and UK about Iran and upsetting a neighbor which has always contributed to their progress and development.

Back to the Martin/Zimmerman case--for me, the most outrageous thing is that the New Black Panther Party has offered a reward for Zimmerman. As Zimmerman has not been indicted and is not wanted by authorities, clearly offering to pay money for the kidnapping (or worse) of a citizen is a crime. But nothing from Eric "My People" Holder or the rest of the administration.
* Even as an adult reader, I empathised completely with how the separation of her parents affected Phoebe and how it culminated in an almost crippling shyness – something I experienced myself at that age. Do you hope that both parents and children could gain something from reading about this kind of situation? Did a real-life experience of this situation help inspire the book?
For those of you who support Food Empowerment Project, one of the reasons you probably do so is because of the connections we make between various causes for justice. A number of years ago, I was able to spend time with a long-time animal rights activist who has been active both in England and in the US. He told me about an important episode in the anti-vivisection movement. (Vivisection is the live experimentation on animals, and anti-vivisectionists are those of us who oppose this practice.)

Further lowering the rear end the differential is lowered as far as possible. The differential is driven from the cross shaft between the diff and the main gear cluster. The differential can effectively be at any angle pivoted around the centreline of the cross shaft. What Williams have done is to lower it as far as possible while still allowing the CV joints some consideration and the starter shaft to be accessed. This does effectively make the gearbox slightly longer.
This isn’t one of those recipes that has a recipe. But I can tell you what I usually do and guesstimate at ingredients and hope that works for you. I tend to use thin-cut chicken breasts. Not only is it quicker, but well, it’s quicker. I like having a thinner cut for a cutlet; it just works better. I put some grated Parmigiano Regianno cheese in my already seasoned breadcrumbs. It adds another kick of flavor and crunch to the cutlet.
From the perspective of my personal looking-glass, what I know for sure is that people decide what they want and believe what they want. No matter what you say or do.

Stern’s figures were based on a financial assessment of the impact of global warming on future generations. The trouble with this is that it’s a very difficult and controversial calculation and one which economists love to argue and get upset about. Many queued up to trash Stern’s assumptions. This provided the denialists with a glut of ammunition and further confused the poor punters.

A. I'm busier. I have less time to watch TV and more time that's spent sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop. But otherwise, it's pretty much the same. I suppose if I looked back I could list a lot of things that I might have done differently, but I don't really know how things would have turned out if I changed it up. So I don't think I'd change anything. I'm just really grateful to be where I am.

Using the same skillet, heat it over high heat, add the tablespoon of olive oil and then add the sausage.

Then stir the sausage, breaking it apart into even smaller chunks, reduce the heat to medium and cook for another four minutes.

The effect this fruit has had on Europe is profound, being loved and loathed in equal measure. The Clementine is very popular in France both as a fruit and as a girl’s name. However, in Germany it is considered to bring bad luck and must always be eaten in twos. The Italians consider the Clementine to be a symbol of fertility yet in Spain it is frequently part of buffets at funerals. Livewithfruit continues to be amazed and humbled by the role fruit can play in different cultures and identities. This first week has been a blast, let’s hope for many more!
I read so many people's blogs and stories about their adoptions; about adoptions from The Bad Place, or other special needs adoptions, or domestic adoptions. The common theme from all of them is that, in most cases, these families need help to complete their adoptions and they are asking for it. Whether they are doing fundraisers, giveaways, or simply asking for donations, these families are asking for help.
Let's imagine for a moment that the anti-monarchists got their way, the Queen were stripped of her crown, and we were asked to pick a president. What sort of person would we want to vote for, if we were completely free to choose? First of all, we'd want someone who is popular not only at home but abroad. We'd want someone who could be relied on to act with grace, dignity, elegance and tact. We'd want someone who would rise above the childish, bickering scramble of politics. We'd want someone who would perform their duties untiringly and uncomplainingly. And we'd want someone who could be guaranteed never to bring the nation into disrepute. It's hard to think of candidates who would fulfil all those criteria. But one does spring to mind. This is where anti-monarchism hits a snag. Because if the people of Britain were free to vote for anyone to be their head of state, the candidate they'd choose would surely be … the Queen.

But happen it did. Ergo, Europe is no longer democratic. One cannot have partial freedom of expression. It is all or nothing, pace Voltaire. It is the primary function of a democracy and without it no society can be called democratic.
I think we would have checked at least

Barriers to understanding pain are starting to fall and scientists and drug firms say a fresh approach is producing potential new drugs to hit where it hurts.
“Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
As much as The Walking Dead stunk in the first half of last season, “Walking Pains” is nothing but high-larious zombie hi-jinks. The only thing missing is Mike Seaver and his best pal Boner getting trapped in a Wal-Mart with nothing but cheap Chinese-made wiffle ball bats to fight off a seemingly endless swarm of cannibalistic undead.
We only know the last sad squires rode slowly towards the sea,
The camera’s were flashing, anticipation in the air, awaiting the Spring 2012 looks to be revealed at the Grammys. I was in shock to see a sea of black make its way down the carpet. Embellished with gold accessories, stars managed to make this cliché look fresh and modern.
I believe good writing always tells a good story, no matter if it is fiction or non-fiction. I juggle a couple of magazine articles, a blog post and at least two book projects on any given day. On top of that, I'm working on either promotions or speaking engagements for my books that are already out or upcoming release. I often have a fiction piece I'm either actively writing or pondering, both for children and adults. (I've had poetry and short stories published, too.)

Ok ... Got to go... Just found out last night that there's a zine exchange tonight and I actually managed to put a few pages together for it! Got to print it now! I'll post about it asap!
Wholesome Nutritional Brown Rice & Diversified Carbohydrates
Across the street from our campground is the site of Belden School where I attended 6th grade a long time ago. The school had sat empty for many years and was torn down two years ago.
7. HIPPIE. Most people who go vegan or veg is because they want to be more environmentally friendly and save more grain for actual people instead of feeding it to animals so we can eat them. They shop at thrift stores, eat vegan, speak to others about their decision, are peaceful, and live more simply. So yes, I suppose people call them hippies. You know what? It has never been bad to be a hippie. I may be a hippie, but I don’t care. If I know I’m taking care of my body, I don’t care what others label me.
What in the world are we going to do with ourselves? Riiiiight?
Henri drives the entire time. Between breaks and the creation of the new documents, it takes about thirty hours. I spend most of the time napping or playing video games. Because of my reflexes, I can master most of the games quickly. The longest it has taken me to beat any of them is about a day. I like the alien war and space games the best. I pretend I’m back on Lorien, fighting Mogadorians, cutting them down, turning them to ash. Henri thinks it’s weird and tries to discourage me from doing it. He says we need to live in the real world, where war and death are a reality, not pretend. As I finish my latest game, I look up. I’m tired of sitting in the truck. The clock on the dash reads 7:58. I yawn, wipe my eyes.
In my world view, when someone does me wrong, I change the circumstances of my life so they cannot do it again. My focus is on me, and what I can change in myself or my life circumstances. Those are the only things really under my control
I smile as I reflect on the fact that she has now
I hate working out but rather enjoy walking and enjoying the out doors so that’s where and how I get my exercise.
Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and soon to join Croatia, all require the ownership of national ID cards (some simply to posses and other to always carry).
Concept: On a high school science class field trip to a physics lab to witness an experiment, something goes horribly wrong and it looks like the 30+ kids of one class are in mortal danger, but it seemingly comes to nothing and everyone is safe.
The other stand out moment here on the first day at this site was, Gav finding an IBERIAN GREEN WOODPECKER in a small clump of trees at least half a mile away, I am still in awe!!
ChokeyCharlie started to cry. This was not unexpected because he missed his nap time this afternoon.
It took nearly an hour of coaxing and another hour of funny shots to get this blurry one from DD4L. The short version of why he is this person is that he inspires me to be a better person.
DCI Gailey added: "He went out of his way to help members of the community on a day-to-day basis. "There is no motive for the crime at present and it is absolutely pivotal to take this inquiry forward that I establish what the motive is. I'm not ruling anything out. I don't have a motive for this murder. I'm keeping an open mind as to what the motive is."

I already had this LP in its much more common mono version, but I was very pleased to find this one in a local charity shop as I find stereo sound gives the listener much more satisfaction.

Kayla is doing softball again, over at her moms ;) SHES ONE GREAT BALL PLAYER. Hope we can go to some of her games!! Josiah did not do baseball afterall but is taking drum lessons and will be trying out for The Dinuba Aqua Emps swim team
The Mountaineer was founded in 1939, and is family owned and operated. The rooms are very cheap (under $50 a night), and you basically get what you pay for. But the place has a homey charm and the woodsy architecture has an appeal that harkens back to the postwar way of American family vacationing.
The GOP has a lot of work to do. I have no plans on helping it as it continually shoots itself in the foot. The Republican Party is weak. The TEA Party has lost considerable steam as it can’t seem to give up it’s progressive ideals long enough to act on its’ own rhetoric. Romney can’t beat Obama, but it won’t be a slaughter. I would argue that Romney will be a good place-card holder for the GOP, giving it another four years to get its act together. Maybe by then the brush fires of liberty will have been started well in advance and another man by the last name Paul will rise in it’s wake! If the Republicans don’t take the presidency in 2012, it will be a failure of the field. None of these guys look very likely to beat Obama, and Obama should be very beatable.
I mean, I got over it, so what's your problem?
Scentsy's philosophy of Simplicity, Authenticity, and Generosity has made us one of the fastest growing companies the direct selling industry has ever seen. And we just keep growing! Right now, Scentsy is expanding into Europe. First comes spreading Scentsy throughout the U.K. and Germany, but after that, who knows? Anything's possible with Scentsy!I was talking to Kathy that night and she sent me a file about joining. After reading that page I was HOOKED! I have been selling Scentsy now for almost two months and I have made enough to pay the starter kit back to us and put money in the bank! What are we saving for right now? I am going to Scentsy Convention in August in Fort Worth, then we are saving for Disney! Yep thats right Scentsy will be paying for my kids and I (I think we will take the hubby too) to Disney.
There were the tender annuals, planted carefully that bloomed unrelentlessly all summer. My beloved Gomphrena “Fireworks” was a favorite. When I picked it up from the nursery, its tag said it would grow to a height of 36”! So astonished with this info on its tag, I even asked the nursery’s owner if that must be a mistake. It turned out, it wasn’t and it bloomed all summer in explosions of pink fireworks 3 feet above my garden bed.
After about 2 days of soaking and stirring the beans I made sure that they were undisturbed for at least a couple of hours before I took the bean water, so the proteins could settle at the bottom with the beans. Apparently these can ruin the dye. I laddled the water above the beans into buckets. Since we wanted to try small sample skeins and get the same results if we liked them, we used jars for our small skeins, taking enough liquid each time to cover the skein comfortably. I left the skeins soak for 48 hours before taking them out and rinsing them.
As Beckett gets older, he is seeing and tracking more things. One of my favorite moments every day is when he first wakes up or when I walk into his line of focus and say hello. There is this sudden moment of recognition where I picture him saying, "Oh there you are! You're the lady with the kisses and the milk!" As a parent, there is really no better moment. It's a pleasure to know that not only does he recognize my face, but he is happy to see me. He grins, and he knows that I will take care of his needs.

It's all making me crazy. Last night, after reading a story about how Arizona has proposed a law that would allow employers to fire women for taking birth control, I lost it. I ended up in the dark kitchen sobbing in front of the sink. I don't really know what cracked, but I have felt so much lately like some kind of crazy person and a second-class citizen. I know work will be fine, that my parents problems aren't my problems and that having them stay with me isn't the worst thing ever, and that these new proposed laws are probably just the death throes of a party who has completely lost touch with the normal, average American, but it just feels like too much to take in, and I'm struggling with which me I want to be in response: raging? or quiet?
And then there are things that are just common sense. If the author says the character is dying, you know his or her death is coming up sometime during the book. The author is not going to postpone the death scene until his or her trilogy is done if he or she announces that it’s coming in the first book. Where and when requires more finely-tuned senses, but there are signs that can tell you these things.
Week 12 Off Centre
Yule or Yuletide ("Yule-time") is a winter festival that was initially celebrated by the historical Germanic people as a pagan religious festival, though it was later absorbed into, and equated with, the Christian festival of Christmas. The festival was originally celebrated from late December to early January on a date determined by the lunar Germanic calendar. The festival was placed on December 25 when the Christian calendar (Julian calendar) was adopted.
There was quite an interesting programme on TV tonight about an art exhibition in Venice and the problems that the artists have had in getting their work to the places that they are going to be shown. One of the exhibitors was Anish Kapoor. He is well known in Nottingham as the designer of the Sky Mirror that is on show outside the Playhouse. There is also a smaller version in the centre of Casino Square in Monte Carlo.

That’s it. So, let’s get started.
Inside, Muffy's friends speculate about Buck's condition, then they talk about what they'll all be doing after graduation(short answer: not much.). Muffy makes a toast to her friends, and everyone finds that their glasses are dribble-glasses, another prank. Yay.
6. “Godless Brother in Love” by Iron & Wine
The second verse is quoted above -- it's sort of a circa-1972 version of the complaint voiced recently by the "we are the 99 percent" movement.
After muttering to myself when I returned home from work (and creeping the cats out in general) I decided to try a different search method. I started calling my phone, room by room, from my land line in the house. Called the bedroom. No answer. Called the basement. No answer. Went to the garage and called the car. No answer. No ringing. No nothing.
I saw plainly that God had delivered me from a prison I did not know I was in. I am completely sure given the amount of control she had over me that if I had stayed with her she would have eventually convinced me that I needed to kill myself. And I would have done it unless God intervened.
Which leads me to a theory that I’ve had since I was a kid… what if when we sleep we’re actually activating another life somewhere… or we’re living a snippet of that life. I know, interesting idea… just not realistic. But it also lends to the thought of multiple timelines for singular existences.
The flow can also increase as a result of intentional spiritual or psychic practices.
"Stand And Deliver" - 5:05
“The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day – the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account… You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed upon them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.”
SEE! A papier-mâché tomato chase someone down the sidewalk whilst perched on a skateboard!
My argument is that sometimes this view was wrong. Just because the polytheistic culture in which they lived saw gods as violent brutes who waged war on humanity did not mean Yahweh ordered the slaughter of all men, women and children in the cities he wanted Israel to conquer. Just because the political class of Jerusalem wanted all citizens to centralize their worship, and therefore their commerce and taxes, within the city did not mean Yahweh was inaccessible outside its walls. Just because the monarchy was unable to stop the Assyrians and Babylonians from overrunning Samaria and Jerusalem did not mean Yahweh had failed, and it did not require the creation of a sin-judgment motif from which to explain their suffering.

Steven Soderbergh is a guy I never really watched all that much before, but for some odd reason within the past 2 months, I’ve watched about 5 of his flicks already and there’s a lot more to come by now. Keeping the streak going now with probably one of his most underrated flicks.

Used Cherry Lynne die too - my favourite - totally loving it - can you tell?
Those of us that are currently trying to live a minimalist lifestyle know that we are probably in the minority.
And last but not least, one of the consultants Justin works with lives in NYC and commutes here every week. He offered to bring the people at work (and me) cookies from Levain Bakery. These cookies are seriously good. And they are 6 ounces a piece! 6 ounces of pure deliciousness.
I was talking with some friends about crazy stuff they did after a breakup, and heard some great stories. It seems that almost everyone has at least one incident in their past of which they’re not proud. One friend ended up sleeping with more than 20 people after her ex, including a few of his very close friends. Another friend continued to check his voice mail (she had the password – and he didn’t know it) for months and months after the break up, and took the liberty of deleting any voice mails from other girls. One friend broke into her ex’s house, and went through his new girlfriend’s things (and came close to stealing or breaking some of her stuff!). Other friends lashed out by getting various piercings and tattoos immediately after their breakups. And, others are a lot more tame, and just dramatically changed their hair by dying it or chopping it all off. And let’s just be honest here, we’re all guilty of Facebook stalking a time or two!
Today I am happy to announce that I will be attending the University of South Florida in pursuit of a Master’s Degree in Medical Sciences: Athletic Training Concentration. This program is mostly online with a 5-day trip to Tampa next summer (2013) and specializes in pediatric sports medicine. I cannot wait to begin as it begins a new journey in my professional development. Meanwhile, this will also allow me to remain with Monroe Physical Therapy and Sports Medicine and working with the student-athletes at Freeburg Community High School.
What Matters Most?
From Nancy Bauer:
This whole ordeal begs the question, is where you are really the smartest thing to advertise on your social networking sites?
My 4-year-old mind was currently under the impression that what happens when you flush is the toilet sucks in any poop there might be, then cleans the water, and spits it back out. So if the dog drank all the water, he would break our toilet forever. And I would be in big trouble.
The global dust belt has not received as much press as the global fashion weeks so you might not be familiar with this story. (Aerosols can be dust, clouds--both liquid water and ice, pollution, sea spray and volcanic ash). Occasionally, dust can be injected into the jet stream, a fast-moving river of air that circles the globe. Asian dust ends up in north America, American dust ends up in Europe, European dust ends up in Asia and so on.
Look, look! I mean, read, READ!

~ that big corporations should be held accountable for their actions and how they affect the populace (yes, it is your fault if you dump mercury in the river and people start getting cancer from it) and that it is time for the people to rise up and demand a government FOR the people and BY the people.
But, Dave didn’t want perfect–he wanted me. And, after all of our years together, he still does. The remarkable part of all this is Dave is more aware of my flaws, faults, and foibles than during the early years of our marriage. He sees me clearly.
These spicy little cupcakes are delicious and perfect for the holidays. In a rush? Cheat by using store bought whipped chocolate frosting. I won't tell.
And Mr Odysseus Grey….is a visitor cat who visits our home on a daily basis. I have no idea where is his real home but then looking at things, he is looking for a permanent resident pass. He has been checking out the house – top bottom – sniffing at the tv rack, tracking slowly to the hallway upstairs, making himself comfortable by sleeping in the kitchen, and having meals from the kitty bowl, just like a resident cat.
The first thing I did was to make the title letters. I used Prussian Blue and Olive chalk inkpads to color a sheet of watercolor paper:
I find that one a little martial for my taste, but this highlights the mainspring of the tragedy in these poems. These men weren’t unwilling conscripts: so many of them left school and university with heads full of Virgil and Horace, and marched straight into a human abbatoir. This was what Wilfred Owen was driving at when he quoted Horace in Dulce et Decorum est, which inevitably is featured in this volume. I shan’t quote from it, because everyone knows it already. This classical education, which encouraged verse composition, gives rise to moments of elegiac beauty, like this from Leslie Coulson’s From the Somme. He was killed in 1916.
I doubt we are in a bubble stage. When you went to an investment conference in 1989, everybody owned Japanese stocks. And in 2000, everybody owned tech stocks. That is the bubble, when the majority of market participants own an asset. I think there are more people that own Apple stock than gold.
Happy Mother's Day!
‘We’ve been treating Cheryl homeopathically. Our practitioner said it was important to let the fever burn off the infection.’
All in all, I preferred B. Though both shared common elements, I felt B was more refined, and because of that, I declared that it was the more expensive of the two. I was wrong, and so was my colleague, Rüdiger.
tiny pieces of you,
More worrying inconsistencies are revealed in the Macpherson Report, as they affect the police. Members of another gang with convictions for racially-motivated crimes were not known to the investigating officers. Having earlier lambasted DS Davidson and other officers for their refusal to accept the race factor in Stephen Lawrence’s murder, Macpherson, three pages later, has no sense of embarrassment in stating: ‘The view of many of the team that the murder of Stephen Lawrence was not solely motivated by racism may well be reflected in this failure to obtain readily available local intelligence’ (para, 20.14). Whether this failure was due to incompetence is not clear but it surely mitigates Macpherson’s accusations of “institutional racism” levelled in paragraph 19.44.
This test is based on how cool you were in School - what crowd you ran with, etc., it's pretty accurate.
Hello my friends! Giovana here bringing you a new challenge for the month of May! This month is all about "Birthdays".

The IIS is pleased to welcome 48 new students on its Graduate Programme in Islamic Studies and Humanities (GPISH) and its Secondary Teacher Education Programme (STEP). The students, who joined these postgraduate programmes in late 2011, represent the diversity of Ismaili communities in both background and origin, coming from Canada, France, India, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, UAE and the USA.
Thereafter I allowed my pure and sinless body to be wounded from the foot to the head, and to be crucified for all the sins of mankind. That same body is now offered each day on the altar so that mankind might love me more and remember my great deeds more often. But now I am totally forgotten, neglected, despised, and expelled as a king is from his own kingdom and in whose place the most wicked robber has been elected and honored.
This is a lot of work, but it is oh, so worth it. What you’ll have at the end of it all are characters that your readers can get behind and root for as they march off to face seemingly impossible odds with a plan that has a real chance of blowing up.
Jake had practice last night, so Matt and I headed to get groceries and grabbed some Mexican food. I got beans with a side of beans topped with guacamole and a little bitty cheese enchilada-it was smaller than a deck of cards. I really need to learn what is best to eat when we are out and about. I know fries are a non-food, burger buns are too much bleached flour. Fried stuff is no good...so, what does that leave, here in the South-sans going to a larger city? There's only so many Fresco bean burritos I can eat from Taco Bell. We have split a bag of carrot sticks and a protein plus drink from the grocery store more than once.
The Darkest Hour is the kind of film I watch for amusement purposes only. Going into it I knew it wasn’t going to be the most though provoking, deepest or smartest film I’d ever seen, I’d read a couple of reviews, I had a general idea of the kind of movie I could expect. But still, Im a sucker for sci-fi and an even bigger sucker for post apocalyptic films, so I decided to give this one a watch. At the very least I expected a brisk, fast paced flick with cool effects and some action. If you ask me, The Darkest Hour is an empty film every step of the way, as most films alien invasion films are. The formula behind these movies is simple: monsters appear, humans run, humans find a way to kill the creatures, humans fight back, monsters die and for all intents and purposes, this is exactly the kind of film The Darkest Hour is. But a film can stick to this formula and still suck, the question remained, would The Darkest Hour at least entertain?
Earlier today I posted a piece, "Unrepresented patent applicants: a little thought", on the IPKat weblog here. Having done so, it occurred to me that there might be quite a few readers of this weblog who don't spend their hours gaily filing away on behalf on cash-comfy multinationals but who have to advise patent applicants with limited resources as to how to deploy their money and find the happy balance between saving money and actually getting a patent granted. They may therefore be better qualified to pass comment.
So have you guys tried this cream b4? how did it work out for you???Is there other cream you've tried thats better, but cheaper??? let me know down in the comment section~~~~

While we are on the topic of color, my mood was thrown right back into cranky when I popped into the new studio on my way home later in the afternoon. The painter spray painted the entire window wall BLACK! Black... I mean like black, black. Ceiling black. My studio was suddenly cave like with every bit of sun being sucked into the oblivion of the wall and ceiling. The building manager said they can't put it back to white. I'll have to do it on my own. Sigh, I have SO much other work to do (my latest Color Canvas piece is due next week!). I did not need painting a wall up to a 15ft ceiling on my list. Argh.
Caution.. spoilers ahead.
So, maybe it’s time to work through this, publicly. For me, there’s always been a balance between the “good times” side of better beer and the thoughtful embrace of better beer as a doctrine. For me, blind allegiance to any system of thought is to be avoided, and constant re-examination merited. Shouldn’t this rigor be applied to beer, too, and to my place (and my company’s place) in it?
She clarified that in the term Chitta Suddhi, refers to the union of chitta-manas-buddhi.
They exchange some punches, and then it goes to the ground. Jake was on top, but Nic quickly reverses and takes the top position. Nic is landing some short elbows from the top.
Second, I began eating healthier and getting more exercise. This is not easy because William and I have very different food preferences. So, I’m taking baby steps. Simultaneously, I’m working on bringing more fun and entertainment into my life. I’m brushing up on my chess skills (I currently am so rusty the Tin Man would feel sorry for me) and in line with the exercise, I’m waiting for the weather to break so William and I can play golf at least a couple times a month. Finally, my daughter is coordinating with me on planning more trips for us to visit together.
When I was small all I wanted was very long blonde, silky dead straight hair... I got the blonde right but that was all that came true in my hair dreams... I had curly, slightly frizzy thick untameable hair... the kind of hair that is the perfect barometer for humidity and rain... the kind of hair that doubles in size at the mere hint of moisture...the kind of hair that won't be told what to do... the kind of hair that requires management and lots of it... So that means I know about hair... how to straighten it and torture it in many different languages... I have tried it all in the name of straight smooth 'un goldilocks' like hair ... I have bound it, ironed it, almost killed it with chemicals not to mention the millions of blow dryers, heated rollers and straighteners that have saved me from a frizzy hell... and yet my hair has survived and continued to grow... Nothing short of a miracle..
If you’re still feeling zooish, go to Bearizona near Williams which is a drive through. You better keep those windows tightly closed and keep moving through because those bears are not shy of humans as a swipe at our bumper that set the car rocking let us know. This zoo is 55% rescues and rehabilitated animals. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoying a working weekend more.
More Whites have died in the years under ANC rule than in British concentration camps. More Whites have died since the ANC took over than in all the years they have planted bombs as a terrorist organization, including the soldiers on the Namibia/Angola border.
I decided that whilst I had a little time and wanted a bit of a break, I would do some Christmas baking. So the other day I found a great recipe and set about baking some Christmas Spice Biscuits. I must say that actually they are really nice, even if I say so myself.
And to hope she never failed………..
Think about it. Think about walking down the street of your local town, and there on a street corner is a guy telling you things like, “God told me ______.” You’d think he was nuts. You’d tell him get help. You’d say to your buddy at church on Sunday, “why do people think that ambushing folks with the word of God is way to evangelize. Don’t they realize that stuff just makes people think we’re all crazy?”
Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) decided that these are “extraordinary” circumstances. “His record reveals that he believes the Constitution is a fluid, evolving document with no fixed meaning.” (Sessions might like to keep only white, male property owners as voters and retain control over slaves.) Sen. John Corbin (R-TX) objected to Liu because he “would use his position as a federal judge to advocate his ideological theories and undermine well-settled principles of the . . . Constitution.” (Sounds to me like the approach that Supreme Court Justices John Robert and Samuel Alito use.) Sen. Dick Durbin (R-IL) was more blatant in their objection to Liu. According to Durbin, No. 2 Senate Democrat, Republicans are just keeping judicial vacancies available, hoping that a Republican is elected president in 2012. (At least he’s honest about it!)
“Framed with a mass of auburn curls, her oval face was complimented by mesmerizing bottle-green eyes and red lips that curved into a captivating smile.”
“….were we intent on improperly feeding the media frenzy, we could now release substantial information that in our view would seriously undermine the quality of this prosecution, and also gravely undermine the credibility of the complainant in this case…..”.
So to help combat the fatigue, I have had to limit myself to one, maybe two "things to do" in a day besides the usual feeding and caring for my two busy boys. Yesterday, my project of the day was laundry. Today, I went on a field trip with my sons preschool to the fire station. I felt pretty good after wards so I pushed the limit and went to the grocery store. Whew! Let's just say, the my little hiney is glued to the recliner. It's gonna' take some thing really good to pry me off of here.
2. On each side of the bookcase, I would like to install these reading/wall lamps, since we enjoy reading in bed at night, and we will be moving the lamp that is currently bedside.

We can see these signs in the increasing floods and droughts, feel it in a land that has been poisoned with pesticides, and those whose hearts are open may hear the cry of the world soul, of the spiritual being of our mother the earth. It is a cry of need and despair, that humanity who was supposed to be the guardian of the planet has forgotten its responsibility and instead desecrates and destroys the earth on a global scale.
Did you read this up in the news this morning? While I was browsing the online news report, I kind of agree to this. From my experience of working as a office manager way back in my previous office, interviews after interviews, I can't seems to find the suitable candidates, and most of the time, it's just settling for the need of having one to fill the position due to 'emergencies'. Most of the time, the candidates will not work up to the standards / marks, with a very simple thing that they are just all lack of communication.
Afraid of failure?
The painting was originally thought to be by Van Gogh, but it was dismissed from his catalogue in 2003 after doubts about its origins. It was thought to be too large, with the signature in the wrong corner. The painting was created during a period during which the artist lived with his brother in Paris, beginning in 1886. Letters from Van Gogh to his brother mention the painting of the wrestlers, which helped historians put the clues together.
I have a hard time with sketches.. I definitely do NOT plan in advance what my layout is going to be. Sketches force me to 'follow the rules.' Yikes!
Then I went to get my hair cut and stock my shelves with groceries. At home Chester was still waiting for his walk, but I was still hoping it would warm up some more. It was up to -26C by the time I got home, but they were not reporting on the wind chill. I decided to have some lunch and watch the cams in the hopes that it might be a bit warmer later. We finally went for our walk around 2pm when it reached -24C and then it suddenly started to warm up – it was -23C by the time we got home and then -21C about 20 minutes later. The sun is shining as it usually is when its very cold.

We need to get stuck, first, Lehrer proposes. Before the imagination can take new pathways, we may need to really feel we're going nowhere.
After the first application of Roundup, maybe 90% of all the pigweed is gone. This still leaves about 10,000 individuals who were exposed to the herbicide but had slight genetic differences that allowed them to survive. In order for those genetic adaptations to be passed on they must show up in the sex cells of the individual. Assuming even that only half of the 10,000 have genetic advantage that can be passed on, that's still 5,000 individuals who survived with the advantage that can be passed on. A very VERY conservative estimate for plant species is a doubling of viable population. This original generation of plants that survived to reproduce is called the "parent" generation in genetics.
When one looks at the early church writings, one notices several things. One must admit that 1 and 2 Clement contain language that is similar to 2 Peter, but Petrine literary dependence on Clement is not the only explanation. Similar ideas and terminology in passages like 1 Clement 23.3 and 2 Clement 11.2 can be explained by their knowledge of 2 Peter, especially since 1 Clement identifies the written source as “scripture” and 2 Clement calls it ‘the prophetic word”. [49] If the source was some unknown, non-Petrine oral tradition that found its way into both the writings of Clement and 2 Peter, those attestations would be exceedingly strange. Micheal Green suggests that the quotations of 2 Peter in 1 & 2 Clement (95 & 150 AD), Aristides (130 AD), the Shepherd of Hermas (120 AD), Valentinus (130 AD) and Hippolytus (180 AD) infer that they all knew 2 Peter and considered it scripture; there’s no logical reason to suggest any common source other than 2 Peter except for a priori skepticism of scripture in general.[50]
When I was very young, I used to pray that I would have the strength to be a martyr. By the time I’d reached my teens, I’d adjusted the prayer that I would be strong enough to deal with whatever life sent me, which, dear God, I suggested, I hoped would not be martyrdom. With increasing self-knowledge, I have considerably lengthened the list of things not to be included.
My Dad always used to say “children are a worry from the cradle til the grave” and it’s only since having a child of my own that I fully appreciate his wise statment. Jess is hardly a child now at almost 20 years old but she will always be my baby.
When I eventually became an adult, the mail kind of lost it's luster for me. Most of my friends and I email or talk on the phone, so the mail became something that I didn't really enjoy. It was mostly junk mail and bills...basically someone asking for the money that I felt like I didn't have. Until now. After months of waiting, Number One Son got a couple of large envelopes, one from Charlotte and one from Greenville ...news we'd all been anxiously waiting for....

Ah, Colorado - the state with more microbreweries per capita than any other state in this great Union, and I'm currently trying to hit them all. The perks of being an outside salesman. I've been in Denver for just over 48 hours, and have hit no less than a half dozen beer destinations. It started Monday night after a long day of working and worrying whether or not I'd be wearing a wardrobe from Target all week. well, about 2 PM on said workday my luggage arrived at my hotel, putting an end to any worrying, and allowing me to concentrate on beer that evening.
In a town where the economy has largely collapsed, the project of connecting local small food-producers with consumers in nearby cities is motivated more by the possibility of job creation than it is by pursuit of culinary nirvana.

Yet democratic movements spread like wildfire throughout the Middle East, youth movements come alive in the U.K., France, Chile and Spain, rebellion takes to the streets in Greece, and Occupy Wall Street wakes up the U.S. Dystopia and global rebellion indeed. This year’s conference theme focuses our attention on the problems and alternatives we face in our struggle for a just and better world.

So, he does give me this bit, though, he tells me I need to call my doctor and tell her what is going on. He advises me of this telling me she will probably tweak my meds just a bit, or something. So I do. I do and I leave a message explaining the push of the anxiety upon my body and how it feels like I've done something horribly wrong and I've sleepless nights and flighty thoughts. They (the receptionist) call me back to tell me they've moved me up from next Thursday to Tuesday and if I need to be seen before then, I can escort myself to the emergency room, have a nice day.

Fans filled sets of bleachers surrounding each of the eight fields at Fabens park, some of which had people surrounding the outfield fences as well. The size of the crowd forced Croucher to expand parking in to a second parking lot.

The mango trees had two kinds of leaves: dark green ones and the light green ones. The light green ones were the new leaves. The new leaves had a squishy texture that reminded me of fish. I would collect all the new leaves, and I would place them on the table. I would get a pas-pas (the stik with paper strips at the end. used to drive away the flies) and wave it over the “fishes” and cry out Bili na kayo! Bili na kayo![7]

The Ministry of Interior has a symbolic importance in the ongoing political crisis that engulfed the country as the last American troops were withdrawing a little more than a week ago. The crisis began when a spokesman for the ministry, which is controlled by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, publicly accused the country’s Sunni vice-president, Tariq al-Hashimi, of running a death squad.
Roberto Mancini, knowing United would have to come out and seek an equaliser in the second half, made a defensive change and his full-backs attacked rarely in this half. Nasri and Silva switched flanks but this seems to have been just to mix up their forward line and perhaps get Silva involved more often as he had a pretty quiet game by his standards.
Given the above, doesn't it make sense to make your body as inhospitable as possible? If you were a germ, where would you rather hang out? In a tropical paradise where fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains nourish a pristine ecosystem? Or a wasteland composed of hardened Twinkie cream, Slim Jims, chicken wings and cheap tequila?

The only danger is if you go overboard and begin to try to place dates, to calculate exactly when it is going to happen, to be too concerned about specific events which are occurring and too quick to place them in categories so that they fit into chapters of the Apocalypse.

With most of the wedding planning check list crossed off, we're finally thinking a bit about our honeymoon. It's been on the back burner up until now, and the only thing we really have planned are our flights and hotels. While I'm sure that it's hard to go to Hawaii and not have the best time - I'd love to go with a short list of must see/must do items.

When it was time to take the children to the bathroom, it was decided that the girls would go with one teacher and the boys would go with the other. The young teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the men's room when one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the urinal.
However, there is a fundamental pulse in Self's article I do respond to. Because of the increased commercialism of literary production, this need for clarity appears to have tipped over into the need for 'cosy certainties'. As a writer I've always specifically wanted to avoid the cosy certainties, but as a former schoolteacher I've always felt the need to woo readers, to allow them to feel comfortable in the world of my writing, and indeed get them on my side, before pushing them on further than they may have expected. But as I've said before, this challenge is now all the greater.
Look, I know that Jason can be 'hard work' but talk about kicking a man when he's down. But hey, that's my fault for exercising free speech, isn't it? I guess that's why Our Lord told His disciples to clothe the naked. He knew the State wouldn't think to do it. They can consider it war, then. There must be a way for all of Brighton to know of their wicked treatment of the poor. I'll have a think. Still, its heartening to know that its not just the homeless that the State has it in for,
You need to get a ticket here. Cool thing is - you put your money in a vending machine and get a ticket for that amount. Then, every time you use it, money is subtracted. You can recharge the same card. I'm like a total authority on the CTA now! Aren't you impressed? (By the way, the attendant thought I was nuts for taking a picture of this. He asked me, "Is it really that interesting?" I was afraid he'd think I was even more insane if I told him I was going to blog about it.)

Finally, there’s the run-off presidential election in France, which could have enormous impact on Germany and Europe. From the moment the debt crisis began in 2008, the responsibility of fixing it has rested primarily on the German-French axis. Truth be told, President Sarkozy’s main responsibility has been to embrace the solutions coming from Berlin, giving them added legitimacy in the eyes of Europe and the rest of the world.
To the first objection, I'm going to have to disagree. I don't think Mr. Snyder cares that WBC says what they do. His objection is to the emotional trauma and harassment his family received from the WBC at his son's funeral. There I have to agree. A sign that says "God loves dead soldiers" can't be construed as anything other than harassment, particularly when directed at a captive audience, which mourners at a funeral are.
So I guess you could say that more than all of them have germinated, or that I got greater than 100% germination rates on most of my plants. How’s that for some kickass logic?

It was very touching to see the joy and excitement in the faces of people, after the gift items were given to them. We also had games and dancing competitions to make the event more exciting. The turn-out was amazing and I had the fun of my life!
I'm certain y'all know what I'm talkin' about here. That's a lonely place to be and quite frankly, it sucks.
However, there is a lot of talk in the book about how much Ivy worries about her grandfather while he's down in the mine, they talk about working in the mine like it's a form of cruel and unusual punishment, and in the end there is a mining accident with lots of details. There are references to real life mining disasters, descriptions of the families waiting at the church for news, and descriptions of what may or may not be going on down there...explosions, rock falls, floods, drowning, deaths...all very scary, especially if your Daddy is a coal miner.
Some of my favourite things include being able to pay my bills on time and immersing myself in a good historical novel.

3. Tulisa Contostavlos has topped the FHM’s Sexiest Woman in the World poll knocking off last year’s winner Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Cheryl Cole and Rihanna made up the top three. I have to say that’s pretty surprising. It’s amazing what a stint on X Factor can do. I’m sure the sex tape scandal made sure she clinched the deal. I think she’s pretty but sexiest woman in the world? Not so sure.
It’s all in the details. Both editors and designers must have a keen eye for specifics. Picking up on the small things that count is an ability treasured in both fields, and one that can dictate either failure or success.

Winning the PFA Player of the Year Award was widely expected; when the media report other candidates such as Wayne Rooney noting that Robin van Persie will – not might – win, it is as much of a foregone conclusion as you get. Rooney would have noted that from dressing room gossip about whom players voted for. To be honest, I cannot think of anyone who would have seriously rivalled van Persie, perhaps Joe Hart but that is it. The rest were populist nominees, players whom the back pages have raved about but their inconsistencies over the course of the season would have rendered the award irrelevant had they won.
The Saylorsburg property consists of a massive chalet surrounded by numerous out buildings, including recreational centers, dormitories, a helicopter pad, and firing ranges.
Honestly, I wondered why Kelsier hadn't destroyed the Pits a long time before this. It didn't exactly fit in with their plan, but it is a major strike against the empire and would have helped lend chaos before the house war even started. I'm not sure if this will affect the skaa at all, except that obviously those condemned will no longer work and die in the mines.
In summation, there are really only a few key points to remember when dining at a fine restaurant. Be thoughtful, be patient, be understanding. Servers are human too; we aren’t robots able to produce a culinary miracle to satisfy your slightest craving at a moment’s notice. If you treat us terribly, just be prepared to know we’ve given you your own little nickname in the kitchen and, trust me, it’s not flattering. Neither is the portrait the servers and hostess are painting of you to the people who don’t leave the kitchen.

The situation was scary at first, but with my new control of the dream it became a bit fun, and we defeated most or all the zombies on this underground level; and then we went to a lower underground level, and we started fighting more zombie-like beings.
Colton said he met his miscarried sister, whom no one had told him about, and his great grandfather who died 30 years before Colton was born, then shared impossible-to-know details about each. He describes the horse that only Jesus could ride, about how “reaaally big” God and his chair are, and how the Holy Spirit “shoots down power” from heaven to help us.
I’ve already raved about The Arbor, pronouncing it to be one of two winners of my own La Jefita awards for the best female-directed film of 2011. So you’ll excuse me for puffing this one again — it’s just so good. It’s ostensibly a biography of Andrea Dunbar, a precociously gifted young playwright who emerged from a miserable housing estate in Yorkshire rife with the diseases that often accompany poverty — racism, alcoholism, mutual misery. Her plays re-created those voices and conflicts, and was called “a genius straight from the slums.” Meanwhile, Dunbar never escaped that world: she died at age 29 in a pub after a hard life of drinking, bad relationships, with three children born to three different men.

Since our food is so nutritionally depleted these days, there is no getting away from taking vitamin and mineral supplements to help get the nutrition that is needed. If we supplement our children’s diet they will be brighter, happier and have less weight issues.

I'm not sure why, but the bath was not okay. I don't remember the reason my mom gave me, but she told me to take a quick shower instead.
Here's a few of my pepper plants. I actually have a whole flat of various types of peppers that I started from seeds that I'm still waiting for them to grow big enough to transplant. They're slow for whatever reason...but are growing. I planted a lot of bell peppers this year, so that I can put them up in the freezer and have peppers ready to cook with the beef that we'll have when we butcher Baby Bolt later.

I looked around, the gym was packed with a cross-section of humanity comprised of older men (at least 60) and female whipper-snappers years my junior (most late 20s early 30s). Knowing my older kids regularly attend this gym as it always is with teenagers one must come and go without “embarrassing” one’s offspring. (Sadly the definition of embarrassment amongst the teenage crowd can be simply breathing within 500 yards of the kids or their friends). I surveyed the joint. Several women were hard at work jogging on the treadmills and all of them with earphones and iPods/cell phones “tuned out” to music. I took my place and placed the earphones in my ears quite proud of how I was now “totally cool” (too bad the kids weren’t there to witness this one) and started on the treadmill. My normal workout is about 20-25 minutes of speed walking. I looked at the clock, five minutes had already passed. I am now very assured of my “coolness” as I too am now listening to tunes and power walking my way to less “flab.”
It's a traditional Sunday roast tonight at the firefoodie household so I visited my favourite farm shop on the way home from Luca's rugby match. Foxbury Farm, near Burford in Oxfordshire, one of the best local farm shops around here. We had already decided on pork so I chose a portion of boned shoulder and had the butcher score the skin nicely so we would have loads of delicious crackling. The fresh produce section had some lovely locally grown brussels sprouts, our first dose of brussels for the year. It was here that I also found some great local streaky bacon.

Naj Bueno has responsibility for business development with an emphasis on international business development. eDisclosure marketing, particularly in London, is pretty staid, and no one would call Naj staid. She and Charles Holloway make a good team, and you can judge Millnet’s international reach by the fact that I came across Naj and Charles last year at the big US shows – LegalTech in New York and ILTA in Nashville – as well as at IQPC in Munich, with an apparently full diary of meetings each time.
Long lines, overwhelming crowds, whiny adults and kids, and less than a minute of joy sounds more like a trip to Disneyland than the inaugural 626 Asian Night Market. Situated in Pasadena, an area that borders many cities with largely Asian, predominately Chinese, immigrant demographic familiar with the night market traditions of Asia, this highly anticipated event sounds like it was doomed from the start. The founders of the night market advertised in several global and local newspapers, and some of the places Asians spend most of their time hanging out these days: Youtube & Facebook. Then, these disgruntled Asians that attended the night market went on Yelp.com, another favorite hangout spot (we Asians love judging things don’t we? is it the inner “tiger-mom” in us?) among Asians, to complain, not so much about the food quality, but rather the horrendous wait times for food and the imminent danger of getting trampled by their fellow Asians in hot pursuit of Taiwanese street snacks. This sounds more like the running of the bulls than a food festival. You would think the organizers, Taiwanese immigrants themselves, would have know that a lot of Chinese people love settling in the places like Southern California because they can get all the foods they love from their homelands BUT with American suburban conveniences of safety (so they think) and TONS of space and sprawl to get away from noisy urban centers. HELLO, look no further than the suburban architecture of Asian monster homes with its unnecessary interior spaces (who needs three dens?) and the lack furniture and decorations to even cover that much space as proof of how much Asians love U.S. ‘burbs!
This response reflects a rather arrogant and ignorant attitude. It loads all the burden of documenting and explaining data manipulation onto whistleblowers. Some journal editors are simply not prepared to live up to their responsibilities and take a fair share of the investigative work.

So why take them? Because “even though these stimulants inhibit our epiphanies (and sicken us with addiction), they seem to dramatically increase other kinds of creativity.” It all boils down to pleasure. Amphetamines act primarily on a network of neurons that uses dopamine. Dopamine plays a major role in the brain system that is responsible for reward-driven learning. A sense of pleasure is the brain’s way of telling you, “Hey, Stupid! Look over here.”
In a large skillet melt butter over low heat until it sizzles. Add leeks, zucchini, carrots, and asparagus tips. Stir with a large spoon to coat in butter. Raise heat slightly to maintain a moderate cooking temperature. Sauté vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they are just tender, but not mushy (about 6 minutes). Some of the leeks will separate into lose rings. Gently stir in lima beans and corn. Raise heat again to bring mixture to a very low simmer. Stir occasionally again until beans and corn are heated through. Remove from heat, add tarragon, salt, and pepper, gently tossing to coat. Taste for and adjust seasoning to your own preference. Serve immediately.

I was not lying when I said I would not do anything but craft all day. I was able to finish 2 more layouts. The first one is a scrap lift. I saw the layout at the store and loved it.

There are several sentiments they suggest using when you click on the link I provided. Creole for Haiti and Spanish for The Dominican Republic. You can either make these sentiments computer generated, or simply hand write them on the inside. A lot of these children speak little to no English, so no sentiments unless you use one of theirs. If you do not have time to print or write out the sentiments in their languages, just leave them blank, as I am sure they will appreciate your handmade card without!!!

West Virginia really is a unique place to live. It’s elevation and geographical location allows it to be the home for many different plants and animals. Birding in particular is a lot of in West Virginia. Getting up in the early morning, feeling that fresh mountain air on your face and listening to the birds sing is a really great way to start any day. If you are going to go birding in West Virginia, there are some birds that you definitely must see. After doing a little birding myself, these are my five favorite birds in West Virginia.

Since the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union in 1991, the world has gained greater access to Eastern European archives. This emerging historical field still poses serious research problems for genealogists seeking ancestors in this part of the world. Some countries forbid access to and duplication of their historical treasures. Genealogists often have to learn to read several foreign languages in order to trace single pedigrees. The Federation of East European Family History Societies (FEEFHS) is committed to sharing the latest genealogical research developments for Eastern and Central Europe with the public and facilitating the usage of these sources.

My daughter is constantly losing her bows, and if you have purchased them before, you know they are not cheap! I am always trying to keep track of all of her hair accessories, because the last thing I want to do is have to replace them. So, on my search to find a bow holder that she could actually use, I found super expensive ones, but were flimsy and didn't match her room. She was very specific in what she wanted, and the boutiques were charging upwards of $25 to $45 per holder. So I figured...why not just make one myself!
Bake for 20-22 minutes. Enjoy!
Soon, she gazed out the window at one of Georgetown’s stately old houses, and her mind raced back to her childhood home. She wished she could climb the worn stairs to her room, to wander the neighborhood where she’d been just another kid on the block, not the prodigy others had labeled her. She wanted to go back in time and skip rope with her friends, canoe into the marsh, and catch fiddler crabs. It had all come too quickly to an end.
After cutting out the base of the purse, I used the Tri Framette 0384 as the top and latch of the purse. I started out by creating a mat of the whole frame. Then in the Funtime software I placed a score line about half way through the outline and added 2 holes for the ribbon to go through. For a little more pop, I also created an outlined of the buds. Then I added the vine and the buds from the Tri Framette to the mat that I made.
I never tried anything from Yves Rocher and it seems like a fairly nice product, from reading reviews. But once again, not really up to my standards or what I would expect from LuxeBox. It’s something I could use, but not what I would live without. I received 50mL (worth $2.40)
Not until the boom in the use of smaller computers of the 1980s did the NTDS start to face obsolescence. Development of successor systems began in the mid 1980s, and by the mid 1990s, a variety of cheaper, faster, smaller and lighter systems began to replace it. Today several high bandwidth data links working in conjunction with advanced versions of the computer systems used in NTDS perform the battle management function.
I'm going to be arbitrary and say that the Konrath/Eisler piece marks the point at which self-publishing went mainstream (at least, as mainstream as publishing business models ever get). Maybe it went mainstream earlier, but certainly not any later - anything I've heard of is mainstream, because I have my ear to the ground on exactly nothing. If nothing else, Barry Eisler admitting that he passed up a half-million-dollar advance to self-publish was a huge event, without any precedent that I'm aware of.
ZP: Yeah, and were able to do some of that with Entanglements, but I usually find the things that are the surprising things the most awarding and there weren’t near enough of those with Entanglements because it’s just impractical to just play around with things the same way it is with something a little bit smaller.

He nodded and handed each of the boys two ice cream cones. He held one out to me. “Don’t spoil your dinner, but eat this before it melts. Okay?”
All sensible folk are terrified of the vicious Shark but we go goosebumpy over the lovely Dolphin with its smiley face and flappy flippers. The Dolphin is also a merciless hunter, just not of people. Many people love ‘birds’ “Oh I love birds” they will proclaim. But I am going to go out on a limb and bet this does not include Vultures so much.
I held on to this post for a bit and an entire season managed to pass before getting around to it. October and November are usually busy months for people in general, those months seem to revolve around preparing for holidays and doing strange things like looking for things on sale that we don't really need but really can't pass up the opportunity to buy at a reduced price. Fortunately, I have managed to buy very little this shopping season in terms of random items, though it was tempting. Since the holidays passed, a handful of larger snowstorms hit the East cost and buried most of everything in snow. It seems as though layers and layers of snow piles on the same half melted or unmelted piles every other week making for ugly monuments and to no surprise, the loss of parking spaces. When it snows around here, it makes for pretty messy commutes and extends the day because public transportation will have some delays. At the end of the day, I feel less motivated to update despite still collecting and trying new brews.
As a point of interest, the cheese I most enjoyed from my experiment at the Cheese Boutique was Roaring Forties Blue Cheese from Australia. This cheese is produced at King Island Dairy by cheesemaker Ueli Berger. I’ll explore this specific cheese deeper in a subsequent post. Let’s just say that one cheese alone made it worth the trip.

I’m getting ahead of myself. You dip the beet rollups into the tempura batter, and carefully lower them into the oil. The first one I put in made the oil bubble like crazy, and within seconds it was (only slightly) burned. So I turned it down. And then, after a few batches, it was taking what felt like forever to cook. So I turned it up…You get the picture.

The Altran Engineering Academy has a proven track record as the launching pad for a career in F1. 2004 winner Mark Caldwell continues to work with the team as a CAD engineer, while other winners and finalists have worked with the team in trackside and factory roles, and continue to do so. The 2009 Academy winner, Helen Makey, triumphed with a presentation on enhancing energy efficiency through moveable aerodynamics. She was the competition’s first female winner, and recently had her contract extended to continue working in the team’s performance department.

Once I had come home and unburdened myself, it was all I could do to restrain myself from turning right back around and returning to the treasure trove! But I thought I had better take some time to soak it all in, share the story with you, and then nose around the next time I am in the market to see if there is anything left we could look through. Even if he does manage to off-load everything else, I'm confident we made judicious choices and won't regret anything we left behind.

Nearly 30 years on, I am enjoying looking through these magazines. Here are some things I have observed:
Isn’t it amazing that we should learn about this incident from a newspaper in a country with a long and continuing record of muzzling truth? We would almost certainly still be in the dark were it not for Kommersant. Though we pride ourselves on living in a free country, we are obliged to rely on the media of a gangster state to learn what is happening on our own streets.
When it’s all said and done I have faith in the front office and the process. While I’ll openly admit I think we have bigger fish to fry, if we end up taking Blackmon, Wright or Floyd I’ll be immensely excited because it means the organization feel they have a young receiver to accept the mantle from Steve Smith, and getting Cam a long-term target isn’t a bad thing

The schedule is totally booked the next day (my day off) but knowing the cat must be seen, I’m pushing for first thing in the morning. And the gal, is saying all these plans she has and wants to schedule the appointment in 2 days. I’m having to insist the problem is life threatening and go through the spiel again. Finally, I ask if she has any friends that could bring the cat in first thing tomorrow morning. She lights up and decides to have a friend bring the kitty in.

I went to see Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat last night. First of all, the show was wonderful. But second of all, I was thrilled to have a Brownie a la mode that was gluten free. The staff was great when my mom called to order the tickets (I think she asked them about 20 gluten related questions- and yes that is one of the many reason I love her). And the wait staff was great too.
So tomorrow he moves again, ready or not. This disease is intellectually fascinating and utterly heartbreaking. I can honestly say that given a choice, I would have preferred to remain ignorant of this particular knowledge.
That reminded me of some literary scams which pass themselves off as legitimate. Fake agents may take kickbacks from vanity presses to make it appear that they have sales, or they claim to have “worked with” commercial publishers. Many vanity presses will say they’re not by any means vanity presses – they’re co-publishers, subsidy publishers, traditional publishers, etc.

How did we become Akumal Addicts? One morning in early Jan. 2005, after it had been snowing for a week and road closures were eminent, I decided I needed to get somewhere warm and welcoming. I had a photo of a condo on Half Moon Bay up on the 'frig that a friend had given to us at a Christmas party. After staring longingly at the photo, I started looking for a place to stay on HMB, not having any idea it was high season. Of course, nothing was available. One wonderful travel agent told me she had found a hotel room for us but told me to see if I could find a flight first. Oh, my. By the time I secured the flight and confirmed the hotel room, it was about 2:30 in the afternoon. We ran around throwing things in a couple of suitcases, jumped in the car and made the 3 1/2 hour drive up to Reno with white knuckles. Cars were spinning out all around us. We spent that night in Reno and flew out the next morning. We had our feet in the sand that afternoon. It was love at first sight! Half Moon Bay is an absolutely magical place.

When I was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago I came home a little numbed by the experience. I was not distraught or fearful or totally overwhelmed. I was puzzled about the reason for it. I don’t believe any experience we have in this life, good or bad, is a wasted experience.
I loved so many things about it. Even though it did take up a lot of my time, it forced me to post every day, even if it was just something short. And after the challenge, it definitely left me relieved that I only had to post Monday, Wednesday and Friday for the rest of the year!

McLaren goes on to discuss religious violence in the post 9/11 era and violent language by Muslims, Israelis and U.S. Televangelists. “A lot is at stake,” he tells us. I (and I suppose Pete) would agree. However, it seems to me that the implication is that our interpretation of Scripture should somehow be a reaction to others’ misinterpretation.

Second, the primary reason legacy publishing has traditionally been able to take 85% of an author's earnings is distribution. Because no author could cost-effectively distribute her books in paper without a distribution partner, legacy publishers have been in a position to charge an 85% monopoly rent for paper distribution. The other services they provide -- enumerated above -- are add-ons. How can we be confident about the relative value of distribution vs the add-ons? Because if those other services could be disaggregated from distribution, no author in his right mind would pay anywhere near 85% for them, and publishers would not have the negotiating leverage to charge such an amount.

2. Do as much as you can the night before. Make sure homework is completed and signed, backpacks are ready to go, and lunches are made. Set out clothes for little kids to eliminate an hour-long battle of what to wear. (This next one pertains to my 6-year-old) - attempt to find 2 matching shoes and lock them in a safe so he'll be able to locate them in the morning. If you can't find 2 matching shoes, try to at least find a left and right shoe of pairs that look similar.

But not this week! For lunch this week we have PB&J for grown-ups! Not that limp, peanut-butter-and-white-bread-soaked-with-grape-jelly sandwich that I loathed when I was a child! You see, I've figured out the obvious: that if you use good fruit preserves on good, thick, whole wheat bread, the sandwich doesn't get soggy. Plus, for less than what I have been spending on take-out lunches on Fridays (when I usually go to a client's office for work), I can have a whole week of sandwiches with almond butter. Yum, yum!
So while I sit around and can do nothing while recovering, you can be sure I will be hanging out on Pinterest and hoping to ignore pain! At least I won't be bored huh?

We've survived our first week of junior kindergarten and daycare. It's an 8:45 to noon thing, plus driving time. If we had chosen afternoons instead of mornings, it would have been from 4:45 to 8pm. I wasn't exaggerating about the Argentina-time thing.

Shirley Scott: Hammond B-3 great Shirley Scott (1934-2002) often played with John Coltrane in the 1950s but rose to fame as part of Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis’s group. Her long string of Impulse albums included these two, among her best, alternating her trio with a big band arranged by Oliver Nelson.
And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause?” He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.” They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?” He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.

I have grown to love bath time with Benjamin when he’s not being a complete and utter pain. He eagerly wants to help us wash him, as long as it’s not behind his ears. And I know I posted this on facebook, but it bears repeating:
Paul professed to all his listeners that he belonged to God. He had experienced a change of ownership. He had recognised that the purpose of the cross was to purchase a lost human race from the bondage of evil. No one could do it but Jesus Christ. Hear these words from Romans 8:2-3.
If I love Him, He will love me, if I seek Him early I will find Him and if I seek Him diligently He will reward me. James 4 v 8 says if I draw near to GOD, God will draw near to me.
“It describes (Arminianism or Arminian theology) not so much a movement as an outlook on salvation (and other theological subjects) shared by people who differ on other matters…It… connotes that form of Protestant theology that rejects unconditional election (and especially unconditional reprobation), limited atonement, and irresistible grace because it affirms the character of God as compassionate, having universal love for the whole world and everyone in it, and extending grace-restored free will to accept or resist the grace of God, which leads to either eternal life or spiritual destruction. (Non liberal) Arminians do not deny total depravity (even if they prefer another term to denote human spiritual helplessness) or the absolute necessity of supernatural grace for even the first excercise of a good will toward God.”
At the end, over wine and hors d’oeuvres, we shared stories and memories, in an abbreviated but intense shiva. Some of the books Barbara had made and some of her book collection were available for purchase, the proceeds going to the scholarship fund her children are establishing.
Further reading from the source articles :
But our feelings have no bearing on facts, not even grief. Nine years on, I would tell this young man that the best way to honor his father's memory is to ask and understand why the attack that killed him happened. Warmongers framed the debate in the early years to make it seem that those who questioned aggressive policies were unpatriotic. While emotionally effective in a traumatized nation, it is typical neocon nonsense. Police always investigate the motive of a crime. That does not mean they sympathize with the killing! It's just good detective work.
For better and for worse, the other tracks reflect what the two musicians know how to do best. Season's Reverse deconstructs funk, soul and jazz (and maybe even gives a glimpse of a more "popular" side of Grubbs' music). The instrumental Black Horse deconstucts folk dances, western soundtracks, and salsa, and ends with a three-minute guitar duet that updates John Fahey to post-rock. Fahey is the main inspiration behind Bauchredner, a seven-minute guitar dream that surprisingly closes with a triumphant trumpet-driven theme.

Second, Hobgood did include one paragraph that appeared to respond to testimony offered by Durham attorney Bill Cotter (who I know and like) on behalf of Cline. Cotter presented perhaps the most effective defense of Cline offered at the hearing. He didn’t try to defend the truth of Cline’s stories (as Cline’s attorneys did), or even the bizarre nature of her behavior. Instead, he suggested that the Cline-Hudson dispute should be characterized as a personal squabble, rather than something that rises to the level of professional misconduct.

You can always tell when an author is writing from personal experience, and this passage reeks of the kind of passion that only comes from the heart. I imagine Mr. MacKinnon's own service was hard, but ennobling, although strangely I can't find any mention of it. He used to boast of having been Bob Dole's press secretary, but lately that information seems to have slipped his bio, so maybe he also forgot about humping an M-16 through the sweltering rice paddies of Indochina.
Rosettes - small are a 1 inch circle punch and large is a 2.5 inch circle punch. I have seen these before on a few projects and loved how they looked. However, when I've tried making them myself in the past, they always turned out horribly. This time, I misted the paper with water after cutting the curly Q by hand (I just eye-balled it) and then crumpled it up in a ball. Uncrumple carefully and then add some random curls so the flower will curl in and out. Roll it while it is still damp and allow to dry. This worked like a charm!

It is understood the gang arrived at the complex on Thursday morning in a car with Telkom signs on it.

Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

For this card here I sprayed the background with homemade shimmer inks and finished it off with distress inks around the outside. I used the same inks to slightly colour the flower. The stamped image in this card is more of a background feature. To make my shimmer ink sprays I used Stampin’UP!’s peach parfait and pear pizzazz ink refils and frost white shimmer paint and added some of those to Isoprophyl alcohol. the image itself was stamped with peach parfait ink for a tonal effect.

Of course, just because a song is popular doesn't mean YOU have to like it, or hear it played at your wedding. In fact, discerning wedding couples will often go through lists like these to identify the songs they'll place on their "Do Not Play" list! But don't go overboard if you do that. Like them or not, these songs are there because masses of people voted for them with their feet (their dancing feet).

I’m sure you’ve seen footage of safari’s on television, but it’s a much better experience in real life. The best is to go with a friend or a group of friends, book a few days at a game lodge and take a safari out into the wild park. You’ll go in a bus or a jeep, together with a guide and ranger, and you’ll see all the wild, amazing and dangerous animals you’ve only seen in the Zoo or on TV.
For the inside I decided to use this little plastic statue that I've been hoarding forever. I really like it, but I only have one left so every time I go to use it I'd stop. But I'm trying to use the stuff I have so I forced myself to incorporate her:

Castleton would have attracted Day as the village was well known for its important geological specimens. Mawe writing in the preface for his ‘Minerology of Derbyshire’ described Castelton as having ‘such a variety of strata, mines and minerals occur as perhaps no other situation in the kingdom can boast’.
Benefits: librarians aware of current research and publishing trends within the departments they support. They can extract and repackage reuse data. Next up: Health Sciences Library has been collecting information to add to this tool. The initial goal was to allow library staff to feed current publications into their IR, they founda bout 30% were unfindable so the IR can allow them to make the research papers, PowerPoints, publications findabilty.
Stopping piracy, especially in waters where it is a definite danger, is really not a difficult matter. It requires a very simple strategy and the desire to implement the strategy - at a fraction of the costs that have been spent on ransoms. It does not require massive warships patrolling the area. Furthermore, the aim ought to be to prevent the ship from being taken – not to only do something once the ship has been taken.

At your 9 month check up you weighed 19lbs 4oz. and were 28inches long. Your head circumference is 17 3/4 inchs. According to Dr. M, you are in the 75% percentile on height and weight. You are still wearing mainly 9 month clothes, but there are a few 12 month onsies that we have started wearing. You are long in the torso, so we need all the room we can get. Good thing you're a girl! We get much more wear out of dresses :) Notice anything about the bed in the above picture? Finally had to lower it!
Koko is rather the exception in that regard. She stands out like a sore thumb at a glance. Her manic smile is clearly a sign of something is odd about this one. Some might even consider her moe, which is probably running against the grain in a Black Lagoon-like setting. Koko’s wider-than-usual mouth makes me asks why she has such a wide mouth. The childish and girly exterior betrays the calculating and pragmatic mind it carries. To that extent it is already less of a wolf-in-sheepskin as much as just a wolf (as opposed to Jin-Roh, where the “wolf” is actually a wolf pretending to be a sheep inside a wolf’s skin). She is clearly a wolf among wolves, except this wolf looks like a sheep.

I've been lax in writing because I'm still reeling from our chance encounter, this secret boyfriend and I. It happened about two weeks ago on a grassy knoll with tiny fairy lights flickering. It was so beautiful I think I even heard music playing.

Recently, I was talking to my rents, and they are thinking that they may want my car, but in replacement get me a similiar, newer car...I am all for this idea, or I was anyways. Lately I have been noticing alot of door dings on my car, I hit the car a couple of times (mostly my fault), and someone hit me. Last week, I was careless not paying attention and bumped into a car infront of me, in the DRIVE THRU. Luckily, the gentleman was so nice and understanding, there was no damage on his car, and well mine I haven't fixed it yet from the previous time. The other night, I was in a parking lot and once again a car was backing up and just touched my car, there was no damage just a couple of scratches. A car is a car, it is suppose to take you from point A to point B, but I have just been feeling that I am such a bad driver and do not deserve a newer car. It really got to me, and I have been meaning to express it because I take it personally. I started realizing, that its not my car, its not me (well sometimes) but it may in fact bethat I tend to drive alot. I am usually at the mall or a coffee shop where there are cars flying through. I want a newer car, but I am also ok with this car.

This brings up so much more than the experience of one individual, but rather how the NHS (and people in general) view mental health, social media and blogging. I’m struggling to put my thoughts into words but I will try my best. As it stands to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing in my writings here that I would not say to people’s faces. I make sure to not give away any identifying features of other patients, staff or people I’m associated with. I’m not telling their story – I’m telling mine. For a while now, as I start to reach out within “real life” mental health awareness and come out as a full-on mentalist, I’ve been waiting for someone to put two-and-two together and ask if this is “me”. Does expecting to be caught out writing about my mental health defeat my anonymity? No. Are all mental health bloggers liars? No.
It was standing room only at the public meeting in Verwood last night as residents planned their next move to stop Hampshire County Council digging up 700,000 square metres of Moors Valley Country Park land for sand and gravel extraction.
When I opened the door, the man standing there took off his sunglasses and introduced himself as David Oleski, I was too dumbfounded to respond. Unfortunately, due to my dumbfoundedness (?), I don't think I gave the shocked/amazed/overwhelmed/THRILLED reaction that Mr. 12 d might have hoped for... but, I was! Totally floored.
The children danced about with their splendid playthings. No one looked at the tree now, except an old nurse who peered in among the branches, but this was only to make sure that not an apple or fig had been overlooked.
Don’t get me wrong, I am a man of faith. I hold true to my beliefs and I would stand my ground if anyone had tried to take what I value away from me.

There is a LOT going on in these books, and i wouldnt necessarily call Meghan Chase the most exciting female MC I've ever read, but I LOVE this series. I just can't help it. These books are so fun to read and I just get so into it.
Mirza couldn’t and wouldn’t let this happen. He announced his decision to go to Khewa and get Sahibañ. His parents and sister tried to dissuade him saying that the Sayyal women could not be trusted, and that he was taking a big risk going to Khewa. His father’s words of advice and warning are quite revealing of the values of the time, some of which persist even today. He says: “To hell with these women. Their brains are in their heels. They fall in love laughing and, later, tell their story to everyone crying.” Strange as it may sound, the father goes on to say: “One should not step inside the house of a woman with whom he is in love.” However, when the father realized that Mirza would not be dissuaded, he relented, saying: “I see you are determined to go. Now, go, but don’t come back without Sahibañ. It’s a question of our honor. Bring her with you!”
Death, I believe, comes at the top of the list for stress and divorce is quite high up in the list (I have never been divorced).
“My son and wife are very angry, embarrassed walking with me on the road,” he said. “People call me a joker, a cartoon, mad.”
You can well imagine now why we have such issues every single morning getting ready for school. Even if I home schooled her, I suspect we would have this problem. Although if I home schooled her she would want to play video games all day long and wouldn’t comply with the program, let alone the fact that I would have no idea how to educate her.
As I mentioned we had some help. Like a TON of help. Our extended family really came through. It was an overwhelming feeling of love and caring that just made my heart flutter a happy beat through the sadness. It showed me that regardless of the loss we were feeling, we had more than we could ever imagine.

DK: More of the same, but faster. More audiences across more media channels will drive the need for more creative advertising executions. Content marketing and social media will play an increasing role in all that. Also, there will be increasing demands to measure audience and ad execution performance with that audience. And with the ability to measure performance, executions will become increasingly targeted to maximize advertiser results.

Another by-product of pride is vanity, which intensely craves admiration and applause. It is undue assumption of self-importance. It often results in open and rude expression of contempt and hostility. It quickly takes for granted superiority and privilege, which others are slow to concede.

Lately, I've been spending a lot of time deciding just exactly how I'm going to use the lovely enameled poppies that Lynn Bowland sent my way a while back, almost obsessed you could say. In my notes, you can see poppies emerging from waves of green, adorning a vase, even used as the focal for a jaunty flapper hat like one I saw in the slide show.

Not every child that is exposed to a potentially trauma-inducing situation will be traumatized. In fact, two children can be exposed to the same traumatic event, resulting with one child being traumatized while the other is not. A potentially trauma-inducing situation is only traumatic if the child’s experience is one of terror, feeling totally unsafe and powerless to do anything about the situation they found themselves in (freeze). Furthermore, two children exposed to the same potentially trauma-inducing event may both be traumatized, yet their traumatic experience of the event is different. It all depends on how the child experienced that traumatic exposure from a sensory perspective. Again, it is not the event that is the trauma, but it is the experience of that event.
I’ve known Mark for almost 26 years. We were very young, in high school actually when I first met him. And it was a love at first sight, that grew, and we never knew that it was going to turn into sharing our lives together.

One of the aspects of the novel that I really didn’t care for was the vampire sex. And there was a lot, in my opinion. I didn’t find that the sexual encounters furthered the story by any means, but were more of a distraction to the plotline, and I don’t need the acts spelled out for me as a reader. I know it’s a personal preference, and a lot of readers may disagree with me here, but I, personally, found these encounters to be out of place and not something I cared to read at all.

Friday was the big day, and I'd already decided to make it a dry run for any future occasion when I'd be called upon to dress up, like a Christmas do or an evening soiree. I now had the Lady Shoes With Heels, the ancient historical and hand-me-down dresses from Lola II's friend, and I'd bought tights. The technology of tights has come on a long way since the last time I bought any, which would easily have been 15 years ago. That's probably all I'm going to say, other than both fit and performance are vastly improved.

1. A lame excuse over the assassination of Lord Blackheath. This “person” claims a member of the Rothschild family called to tell him. Why would anyone from the Rothschild bloodline tell Fulford anything when he is working against them? The REAL FULFORD would have known that Blackheath had been killed and then replaced by a clone.

I know the following things about insomnia. It doesn't kill you (at least not directly). It's very boring. It's usually stress based (but not this time, since this is an extremely non-stress time in my life, except for the insomnia). It has an element (at least in my case) of self-fulling prophecy. And it's very boring (well worth mentioning again).
But you can see the clouds in advance of the rain actually falling- if you only would look- right? People simply have neglected to look at the stability of various mainstream financial trends- nationally and globally. Those who have looked (and are competent to interpret the simplest data) have seen for years what is coming. Those who have not looked, in contrast, have lately been very surprised- many quite unpleasantly.
I’ve spoken of my love for savory yogurt sauces before. Please make one for these kebabs. It’s so, so simple. Whole milk yogurt, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, olive oil. Ratios to taste, but I like it real garlicky and lemony. Like a cup and a half of yogurt, juice of one lemon, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, tablespoon of olive oil. YUMMMMM.

I did this by filling not one, but two glasses of water and putting them in the fridge to cool off. Nothing helps me cool down as much as cold water INSIDE OF ME, except for maybe getting into a pool of cold water.

Horovitz: Our responsibility is to maintain our moral standards. That’s a very important starting point because in matters of war it can sometimes get blurred. People are always talking about factors like international law, public opinion, the Western world – that is, outside factors that we’re supposed to match up to. No, I say we have to uphold our own standards.

The United States imposes the highest corporate tax in the world and has an unfathomable tax system that sucks vast amounts of money from its citizens. It is $15 trillion in debt because it will not impose any limits on its spending.

Pat: I’m not about to retire on it. I will say that since it first came out in March, I’ve already earned more money from the e-book that I ever received from my print publisher. I think genre fiction has better potential to really take off as an e-book, because there are highly focused communities of readers out there. Amanda Hocking is an example of a genre writer who’s had some astounding e-book success, but she also worked really hard for it and wrote a bunch of books. I just have the one e-book right now.

At that time, producing custom-made clothing and hats for a local clientele was one of the few socially acceptable ways for a woman to make a living. Sarah's business proved successful, but in 1903 she gave up the shop to wed Charles Hawes, a widower and prosperous merchant in nearby Morrowville. Sarah, of course, made the hat she wore for her wedding.
I joined a new gym by my new office. I liked my old gym, Body Business, a lot, but proximity is a big key to my gym attendance. If I have no choice but to drive past it on my way home, I will likely go. However, if I have to drive out of my way to see it, or if it's inconvenient insofar as the "picking up of the kids" ritual goes, I will likely never attend.

Not too long ago here in South Bend, F invited, K, L, and I to go eat at Ponderosa Steakhouse, a place that resembles Sizzler’s but without the charming name and make-your-own tostada bar. F, K, L & I have been trying to find places around town to eat and hang out besides our homes with little luck. (Often times people just tell us to do nature-y things outside of town when we ask what there is to do around here.) After telling F about the Ponderosa Steakhouse building that sits awkwardly in the middle of what might be the largest parking lot in all of America, F enthusiastically with a hint of sarcasm told us that it was a great place to eat as a kid. Like Sizzler, all the Ponderosas, F told us, had pretty much closed up shop. For historical reasons, we had to eat at Ponderosa as it has become a relic of the buffet boom of the eighties. Those sneeze guards and forest green decor — a trait that Sizzler and Ponderosa both share — makes this buffet a living museum of American middle-class family eating culture born out of the suburban eighties.

Ok, so I'm still not putting the pieces together. I am thinking it's still about "communication"... only, on a grander scheme. When, actually, it's about the grand finale of my communication era... before I move on to greater things. Ok, so I learned to talk. Now, let's see if I can "navigate"... navigate my own course. Let's add, to that, "charting my own course"... charting the course that I intend to navigate... instead of having someone else chart my course, and call all the shots.
I haven’t always liked it, but ever since that switch got flipped inside of me (whenever that was) I just enjoy it. I enjoy the feeling of strength, reaching new personal mileage goals (could care less about how fast I am), and that “runner’s high” that comes after a good run.
Should the agreement be broken, for example by one party not providing the service in the agreed manner or period of time, a bright blue mark appears in the palm of the violator.

One year, I took Jeremiah to see Jo Dee Messina in concert, just the two of us, and we had an amazing time. The memories from that night will be with us both for the rest of our lives. It was my only my second concert, and his first. We danced, we sang, and we took turns looking through a monocle, actually a child’s toy, but it was strong enough to see her on the stage from where we were. We were inexperienced as far as concerts went and left after her supposed last song. We had no idea that she would return for an encore, but as we walked down the long hallway, we heard her start another song, so we grabbed the first door we came to and entered into a section of seating that was completely empty. We had the entire section to ourselves for the last hour of the concert! I will never forget that wonderful night with my sweet boy.
Finally we got to our concerns that we may have for Evan, and like usual I draw a blank, except for his vocabulary or lack there of. We've been evaluated by the PAT, twice a year since he was born.

Landing snatched the thought away from him, as he stretched his feet down towards the weathervane on the Tower of Birds. Boots struck iron, wings became arms, and swoop became fall. He tumbled down the sharply-sloping tiles and caught the edge. His head chose that moment to throb, and he dropped to the walkway with enough force to drive him to his knees.
I last wore this top here with a Desigual skirt. Red is my favourite colour but my friend noted the other day that I don't wear red very much. Looking back at my outfit posts, I see that isn't true. I guess I just don't see my friend very often. I should get her to read my blog.

I've previously used the analogy of two black holes, with gravity so strong that virtually everyone will be sucked into any one of these extremes. I'll now present another analogy for these discussions about the JQ. It's a trench war with each party deeply entrenched on each side of the battlefield. It's a situation of complete deadlock. No one is really trying to come to a common view of things, just fervently dismissing each other and dig deeper into the trenches. And here comes another analogy from the First World War: anyone who crosses the battlefield between the two lines will be met by crossfire. I have been placing myself at that field a number of times. Being a man of moderation, I've been wanting to present a balanced view. But generally I have been dismissed from both sides as an extremist. Of course there's no logic to that. But then there's no logic to the two trenches where these combatants have put themselves -- no more than a quarrel between a married couple. It's all deeply emotional.
2009 saw another significant piece of legislation passed dealing with illegal immigration. HB 390 ensures Missouri’s public institutions of higher education do not award financial aid to individuals who are here illegally. The law also requires all post-secondary institutions of higher education to annually certify to the Missouri Department of Higher Education that they have not knowingly awarded financial aid to students who are unlawfully present in the United States.
So it seems that every makeup brand is coming out with their own line of lip butters. What is a lip butter you ask? Basically it’s a tube or pot of tinted lip balm- a product that will give you color and keep lips hydrated.

I’ve never liked when episode titles are made public – either on screen or now on your cable, satellite, or DVR menus. There is the chance they could give away the plot. When we write our episodes we’re always conscious of this and purposely assign titles that are vague. Of course the network promos then pretty much kill any plot points so who cares what the title is?
At first, what disconcerted me most was that I could connect no ideas at all with the word Austerlitz. If my new name had been Morgan or Jones, I could have related it to reality. I even new the name Jaques froma French nursery rhyme. But I had never heard of an Austerlitz before, and from the first I was convinced that no one else bore that name, no one in Wales, or in the Isles, or anywhere else in the world.
This is just one example we have seen of a lasting impact that can happen when relief is brought through the church. With the economy situation, and so many other things that are wearing on the churches outreach, we need to start asking ourselves if we want to continue to build sand castles, or houses built on the rock, that will last for a lifetime, and eternity.

Social satire is a tough category for queries because the book is not plot driven. You've added to your challenge by placing this in a fictive world. You might want to think about leaving out the proper names here and just have Chase on a tour, finding a stamp, etc. Without the proper names we can focus on the gist of the story.

Here is a close up photo:
Robert Malley, another influential liberal voice who had been a Middle East advisor to Bill Clinton when he was president, while more constrained than Friedman, suggests that any sustained display of Palestinian nonviolence if met with Israeli violence would be an embarrassment for Washington. Malley insists that if the Palestinians were to take to the streets in the spirit of Tahrir Square, and Israelis responded violently, as the Netanyahu government certainly, it “would put the United States in an ..acute dilemma about how to react to Israel’s reaction.” The dilemma depicted by Malley derives from Obama constant encouragement of the democratic aspirations of a people who he has repeatedly said deserve their own state on the one side and the unconditional alignment with Israel on the other. Only a confirmed liberal would call this a genuine dilemma, as any informed and objective observer would know, that the U.S. Government would readily accept, as it has repeatedly done in the past, an Israeli claim that force was needed to maintain public order. In this manner, Palestinian nonviolence would be disregarded, and the super-alliance of these two partners in crime once more reaffirmed.
The first time I ever tired stuffed Jalapenos was on Thanksgiving. At the time my family was living in Texas with no family around. Fortunately for us a nice family from our church invited us over for dinner. She served a very traditionally Thanksgiving Dinner (which I was thankful for) except for these Jalapeno Poppers. After just one taste I was hooked and ate about well more than my share. I loved them so much, I have made them every year for Thanksgiving Dinner. I have added a small little twist to her recipe by adding lime to the cream cheese. It just added another little kick that your guest won't be excepting. So if you want to add some spice to your Thanksgiving Dinner this year, be sure to make these.

Not listening to other people enough. I sometimes rush through things too quickly without taking into consideration the other person's opinion. I can also go from one extreme to the other very swiftly. Then, again, I'm a Scorpio, what did you expect?

When my mom came to pick me up the following morning, I was a ball of electric energy. I couldn't stop talking about being saved and how I was going to get baptised and how I was going to go to Heaven because I'd accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior and I hoped that she was saved so that she could go to Heaven too. She agreed to come and watch me get baptised, but she wasn't sure about the "church 3 times a week" request I made of her.

I finally put that to practice with hiking. I knew that if the boys loved playing football when I played with them, they would love hiking if I took them.
And even chronic food poisoning bought on by poorly cooked wild boar cannot spoil the fact that I'm on American TV for like the 5th year running, hopefully off to Australia to do some acting come Summer and wedding plans are dovetailing nicely.
In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad.
Contrary to what some might consider “traditional,” history suggests that the original version included raisons. “The tart’s history has been traced back to the arrival of the filles de marier in the mid-1600s,” writes Toronto Star Food Editor Susan Sampson. “To fill their tarts, these imported brides from France had to make do with what they found in their new larders: maple syrup or sugar, farm-fresh butter and dried fruit (read raisins).”
Ramsey’s heart skipped. Bloody bollocks, it skipped? He couldn’t remember the last time any woman made him react like that, not even Giselle. Or maybe, the impulsive kiss came from weakness with the dawn nearing.
In another film, Skin Deep, a white student, with all his personal details - name, place of origin, all noted on the screen - turns to the screen and confesses the “racism” of his southern family and says: “It’s a tough choice, choosing what’s right and choosing your family.” Yet another “race awareness facilitator” is Edward J. Nichols who achieved fame in the early 90s with a “racial sensitivity” session in which, according to witnesses:
He may not have been your first choice, or mine, but right now he's the only choice we have unless you wanna see the country we grew up in disappear completely. I for one am NOT better off than I was four years ago, and I aim to change that come November. Let's take back America.

Reading about Warren Buffett’s early start reminded me of my initial motivation for exploring ways in which children can be introduced to entrepreneurship as an option for their future. My exploration was about how to ensure that such an option is visible to young people, so they can choose that path if it appeals to them. We can’t expect everyone to gravitate towards starting their own business, but they can’t choose something if they don’t know about it. Of course, we should hope for every young person to be enterprising and innovative in whatever endeavour they choose, regardless of whether they become entrepreneurs or not. Warren Buffett clearly found a path for which he had passion as well as ability very early on. Our goal should be to provide our children with the education, information, and encouragement they need to reach their full potential doing something they enjoy.
Lunch: two grilled chicken breasts, mixed veggies, chipotle mayo, yerba mate tea, AGG
We all gathered around the dining room table visiting and eating yummy hamburgers and sausage that my brother grilled, salad that my mom and I prepared, and chips and drinks that Kristin and Lee picked up. It was a team effort...and low key fun. We finished the meal with gifts and cards to celebrate the mothers at the table.
Despite widespread, vocal opposition, Obamacare was forced upon an unwilling America and now we are learning it will increase costs and deny care, just as we knew it would.

But the sense of sight is a fragile one. Many people don’t enjoy this wonderful sense. As I think about this I’m reminded of several experiences in my life involving eye troubles.
There are some easy ways to keep this skill in shape:
We hope to be able to conduct a seamless migration; shutting down for maintenance some time late Friday night or Saturday (at the latest. We may do it overnight on a weeknight if we're ready earlier), completing a migration of the forum and database to that point, throwing DNS over and then going live on the new servers.
Well, folks, it's time to take it to the couch, as the late, great Dean Martin used to say at the end of his show. Have lots to do and already scheduling my month...the Diaz Bake-o-Rama begins in two weeks...looking forward to making my bischochitos and Mexican Wedding cookies or as my grandson call them, liar cookies. Two years ago, Ian and I spent Christmas in Austin with my daughter. I made the Mexican Wedding cookies, but told my boys that in Italy they're called Liar Cookies...when asked why, I told them to eat one, then if anyone asked if they had eaten any and they denied it, the proof was on their shirts...told them to go to the bathroom and look in the mirror at their shirts...powdered sugar...they thought that was hilarious and they've called them by that name since. Have a great weekend, don't stress so much about the coming season, just enjoy....my motto, "If it don't get don't, it don't get done!" Peace out.
Well fed soil microorganisms then produce the gums and sugars that build crumbly, porous soil texture which provides spaces for roots, passageways for small invertebrates, and room for rain. Since these gums and sugars need to be continually replenished, a steady supply of food — decomposing plant roots and litter alongside water, air and minerals — must be coming their way.
Hope you guys enjoyed the full nursery post! That room really has turned out to be our favorite in the house thus far. It took a lot of hard work, but it's something we both truly love and are proud of. What do you think of it? Anything you would've done differently?
I hadn't planned to go in the Guangzhou Museum, but it appears to offer from its upper balconies the best opportunity for a view. At 10 yuan (less than a dollar), even if the museum is a wash, what the heck. And it's a nice enough little museum.
This blog has been incredibly therapeutic to me over the last two years. I still ocassionally find myself reading some of my earlier posts. It has been quite a journey. The reality is - the rediscovery of me is ongoing. Its supposed to be that way. When I originally started the blog - I used my fat as the "reason" I was writing. While I may have been overweight - the ultimate healing came, not in the weight loss, but in the discovery of what makes me happy.

The Elephant and Wheelbarrow feast did not disappoint - after receiving our choice of a glass of beer or red or white wine, we were served with a Christmas dinner replete with ham, turkey with cranberry sauce, stuffing, baked potato, asparagus, cauliflower and brussels sprouts, topped with a generous splosh of gravy.
The Confederate victory at Kennesaw Mountain would be the last Southern triumph of the Atlanta Campaign. Five days later Sherman was able to move his army around one of Johnston's flanks and Southern troops were forced to give up the mountain and fall back first on the line of the Chattahoochee and soon into the defenses of Atlanta itself. Johnston was replaced by Gen. John Bell Hood who launched poorly coordinated and futile attacks on Sherman's forces, decimating his army and losing Atlanta in the process. The fall of the city drove a bayonet into the heart of the Confederacy.
Today I turned 23 years old. This month also marks this lovely blog, The Poison Pen, running for a whole year. I wanted to do a major post but time doesn’t permit that this evening.
It's becoming a date for announcements of an official nature, too. Last year's May 4th brought details about the then upcoming Star Wars on Blu-ray release. This year... well, maybe we'll get some more announcements about Celebration VI?
I felt bad for the child’s father, and it really hardened me into thinking of how I would raise an autistic child if that is what life threw me. The deep things within the book are excellent. The father & mother, they’re relationship, how things turn out all make for a compelling and real-to-life read. The challenges of keeping the family together must be tough. With that said, I can’t see why so many comments on this book talk about it being a comedy. I don’t see this as the case at all. Some things are amusing, but I don’t think it was made to be a comedy. I’ve also seen some of Good Reads harping on it because they were told it was a mystery, and though the boy is trying to be a detective for a little while, that is not what this book is about either. The book is about the family through and through. The experiences the boy had traveling to London felt real to me as well. I definitely want to continue reading about autism and reading books like this one are great. Seeing the world from Christopher’s perspective, and thinking about your life in this context really makes you think.

To unmold the chilled tart from it's pan, turn a stove burner on, and quickly but carefully turn it over the flame to warm the outside of the tart pan all the way around, using a dish towel to protect your hands. Place your hand on the bottom and gently pry the ring down off the tart. Use a long thin knife to slide the tart off of the bottom of the pan and onto a platter or plate.
This dream was constant many years back and came as a flash and got overlapped with a new one. Even in my subconscious mind I recognized it . Something took control and transported me to another time.
Hollywood soon came calling. Pinza had already appeared in the 1947 classical farrago Carnegie Hall, but now he was to become a leading man. The first film to be released was Strictly Dishonorable, based on a Preston Sturges play. Pinza plays to type as an amorous opera star, and Janet Leigh as a music student who is smitten with him.
Far away across the sea in America the cities are filled with naked people. Men women and children stark naked going about their daily lives. Except for a few who see nakedness in public as missing a few sandwiches to go on a picnic. They understand that sin’s entrance into the world caused God to make clothes for his creatures. They wear clothes as man has been doing since he was kicked out of Eden by God.

Loves 1st grade, chases boys at recess, and is a bit lippy. She started piano last week and loves it. Her new motto is to do what you are not told. Sounds bad but, I love this motto. It means she tries to do things before I ask. I will catch her scrubbing crayon off the wall and she will say "I am doing what I am not told!"
The Koran and hadith contain countless eulogies to violence and jihad in the name of Islam and Allah. The New Testament simply does not. And even the violence in the Old Testament, of which there is a lot, is not carried out for God and it is rarely God Himself who sanctifies these many acts of violence. In fact, most of the examples of violence contained are simply parts of various Old Testament narratives (some historical, some fictional). So the Muslims and Leftists who have jumped on this case of 'Christian terrorism' should question their own motives first.

I would understand if a sign was up, or if the particular place of business understood that you can plug in at most other places, but they are just being weird for whatever reason (and so the misunderstanding is more because of their quirk than your inconsideration). But the level of anger, frustration, and condescension I’ve experienced over this is very odd to me.

When you are in a big suburb of cities it's easy to loose your city identity and not overlap friends. We really wanted to be apart of a community, let me tell you this new community is all about city pride and good ole fashioned Texas sports. That is exciting for us.
Let’s extend this idea of actors being related to writers. Let’s say I have a role to cast. I want a male actor to play a cowboy. I have three different actors. I have Clint Eastwood, Jack Black, and Robert Deniro. Same story, different actors. Can you see how the choice of actor–the choice of the voice–becomes essential to how the story will play out? If I cast the wrong actor for the story I as a director want to tell, I can have a disaster, even though ALL THREE ACTORS are highly skilled and talented.

I was actually really impressed with the liquid foundation, it has SPF 12 and it gave such a nice smooth airbrushed finish without even using a lot. The shade was just a bit light on me, but blended in nicely anyway. It did last for the most of the day, but felt a bit greasy and oily towards the end of the day as with a few other foundations i've tried, and just needed to touch up with MAC's Careblend Pressed Powder. There was also no weird smell and comes in an easy to use pump. They describe it as "Always fresh, never cakey or dry. Resists water and sweat. Stands up to heat and humidity. Feels featherlight and flexible all day. Comfortable coverage up to 18 hours. Medium-to-full coverage."

It is at this stage that I will divert sideways and talk about polygamy and, in a sense, affairs and wife swapping (the politically correct way to say “swinging”). Yes, I know you purist and closed minded people out there hate to hear these words, but think about it this way. In a “non-traditional American couple” one needs to have a better outlook on how to keep one’s self in order to continue to attract the desired mates. These couples will be our best hope during the Zombie Apocalypse and (if this conjecture holds true) will be the ones to repopulate the Earth, assuming some survive. Argue all you want now, but I don’t think there’s much more I need to say.
Here’s a quick quiz on loneliness:

In Protestant churches it is more common to use four red candles (reflecting their traditional use in Christmas decorations) because rose vestments and decorations are not commonly used in Protestant churches. Blue is also a popular alternative color for both Advent vestments and Advent candles, especially in some Anglican and Lutheran churches. This is in keeping with the liturgical seasons; blue means hope and waiting, which aligns with the seasonal meaning of Advent. Other variations of the Advent wreath add a white candle in the center to symbolize Christmas, sometimes known as the "Christ candle." It can be lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. White is the traditional festal color in the Western church. Four red candles with one white one is probably the most common arrangement in Protestant churches in Britain.
The conversation was mystifying, which is standard fare with this child, though I’d like to think if my brain was not mush from weeks of sitting around with my leg up I would have caught on sooner.

The one unit you really need to watch out for are Vikings. If your opponent masses Vikings (in large numbers these are extremely good against Protoss air), then you’ll need to respond with a lot of Phoenix. They really don’t do that much damage against Vikings, but you’ll like their capability to act as shields for the rest of your air force—a Viking needs 9 attacks to kill a Phoenix, and to kill a Void Ray, a Viking will need… 10 attacks. So a Phoenix will take nearly as much time to kill as a Void Ray. Phoenix are also fast, and can chase enemy Vikings that run.

You should be able to trust your agent's judgment - their judgment of your book and its place in the market, their judgment of whether you are being offered a good and realistic deal and their judgment of what is best for your long-term career. But if you think your agent is wrong, you must speak out. Don't make assumptions that they don't value you, don't harbour resentments - ask them to explain what they are doing. And if you still don't like it, it's time to move on. You haven't committed to your agent for life, for better or worse, richer or poorer. There is a termination clause in your contract, remember? You can give notice - probably three months - that you no longer want them to represent you. The books they already represent are likely to stay with them, but it's up to you what you do with future books once you have terminated the contract. It's wise, though, to end your relationship amicably. Don't hurl abuse at them and list their shortcomings. Remember that agents talk to one another and if you abuse one, another is less likely to take you on.
In case you’re wondering, his answer works but it’s not at all what I was expecting. When you ask an expert, you’re expecting to hear stuff you never heard or you never even imagined. Most gurus that I meet these days will tell you that there are no real secrets in life, but putting hard work with sound principles will usually get you where you want to go.

Perhaps, it would be a good move for Labour to adopt a more mature attitude of a similar spirit, sort out which message it wants to get out and act in a more constructive manner and work with the government to find a solution. At the moment the Labour party appears opportunistic, not only on policy relating to income, tax evasion and charity giving but on a range of issues. Labour needs to start showing itself as a credible alternative as a government rather than an anti-coalition party. Or maybe that’s their election strategy and they’ll just fill in Miliband’s blank sheet of paper if and when he gets into Number 10…
Of the many illuminating experiences which can be instructive with regard to knowing that we are truly here, particularly after what might have been the accumulation of many years of almost forgetting that we are here for some good purpose, is the arrival in our lives of a brand new person on this Earth.

Atheists, but not religious people, will love this paper from the latest Science, “Analytical thinking promotes religious disbelief,” (reference below) by Will Gervais and Ara Norenzayan, two psychologists from the University of British Columbia (see also this popular summary in the Los Angeles Times). It shows that there’s an antagonism between analytical thinking and religious belief, such that after engaging in even a short and simple task requiring analytical thinking, one’s faith in God weakens.

The playoff structure in the NHL suffers from the exact same problem that the NBA's does: it takes fucking forever. By the time they are over-promoted so much that I'm willing to consent to pay attention to the highlights on ESPN (I still have never watched a full game all the way through on TV – I lapse into a coma long before the third period is reached), it's only the second round. Within about a week, I'm sick of the fucking games being shown and can't take it any more.
As Christmas approached this year, I must admit, I was not looking forward to it as I usually do. In the past, I have always loved everything remotely connected with Christmas. I love celebrating the birth of Christ, decorations, putting up the trees, shopping, eating, drinking egg nog, Christmas music, driving around to see lights and even wrapping presents. I did a few of those things, but others, I let go by.
The next day was the race itself, and afterwards there was actually an interesting edible…

Then pass your hand from left to right over the food and bless it. You may notice that the food feels warm to your hand even if the food is cold– I like to think that the food is good for me when it feels warm and nourishing to my hand. I have also noticed that when I practice blessing the food, I don’t eat as much. It is important not to let yourself off the hook when you forget to bless the food before you eat.
I love iris because they grow almost no matter what you do or don’t do to them. I have some fancy varieties that I got from my friend the iris farmer last year. I am embarrassed to say that I almost killed those by forgetting to plant them when I got them in the fall. They are in the ground and seem to be thriving but I was too late to expect them to bloom this year.
First, note Jeremiah’s reliance on God. God could heal and God could save. He wasn’t relying on himself. He was relying on God. When we are treated wrongly, we can rely on God to heal us and to save us, too, even if we don’t see a way that is possible. It is God’s decision, of course, but if He decides that’s what we need, then it will be done. Second, note how Jeremiah describes God, “You are my praise.” Magnificent. He’s in a tough spot. He’s in a tough spot because God sent him there. Yet Jeremiah describes God as his “praise.” Do we do the same?
Thankfully she wasn't home when it happened.
WHAT KIND OF MOOD ARE WE IN
In retrospect, I realize now that the culture of drugs in our home had a lot to do with how unsafe I felt. They grew marijuana in a closet under grow lights and sold it. Neighbor boys rolled oregano joints and asked me to give them to my mom as a joke. My mom and stepfather threw parties where people would be so stoned they would pass a joint to me, a kindergartner. Even then, somehow, I knew what they wanted me to do was wrong. My refusing an offered joint was just one small example of how God had already put a fierce conscience inside me.

Though some of the artists are well known and their art recognizable, the majority of artwork and crafts come from people who produced as a hobby, not a business. With the economy still on a slippery slope, the opportunity offered by Randy and Carie Robison was well met by these people. In addition, having their heartwork on display was validation and encouragement especially when a visitor found something they loved and took it home.

A new person is starting in the office next week and I hope it is someone easy to work with, not that we work at the same time but working at a camp ground takes a bit of coordination for things to go well and passing of info is important. I sometimes feel like I am the only one that works at that, in work places but maybe it is just me. Seem to me most people are only interested in the little part of the world that they are in at the time. OK I best get off this line of thought before this really goes down hill, LOL!

Nothing is really pointless, everything has a reason, but what am I doing? Sometimes I think I’m avoiding everything as much as possible. I feel like if I actually clean my room I won’t have any excuse not to study. If I actually get back into shape I won’t have an excuse to call myself lazy. Is that what I’m doing? Am I trying to avoid things like this? I think maybe I am. I think maybe I am doing my best to hide behind what I can so I don’t have to face the truth. Maybe once my room is clean and my clothes are put away I will have to face the fact that I have nothing better to do than to do my work for class. Maybe once I do drop the excess weight and have more muscle tone I can no longer say that someone doesn’t like me or that I can’t do something because I am out of shape. I won’t be able to place the blame on anything else other than myself and that’s scary. I like being able to hide behind my poorly constructed facades. I don’t want to know the truth. The truth hurts and I’ve been hurt enough. The problem is I can’ t continue to live my life this way and I know it. I can’t continue to avoid the truth because eventually it’s going to hit me whether I like it or not.

Mowing takes twice as long because primroses, violets and cowslips have sprung up everywhere this year, and I haven't the heart to cut them. Blogging's had to take a back seat, and this is bad scenesville because I know I'm missing good stuff in all of yours. If it rains for days I'll have the consolation of catching up.

The website has been closed for the Christmas break, and I have been busy behind the scenes getting the sale ready, lots and lots of bargains to be found - I really do think this is our biggest sale ever. We need lots of room (and some cash lol) as we are going to be doing a spot of diversification (is that a word ?!) at CHA at the end of the month, don't worry, we will still be stocking all your fave papercrafting products, just adding a totally new department to the store. I will have to keep you all guessing for the time being, just until we can get it all organised - I am really excited about it and can't wait to spill the beans !!
Not only must we accept that basic properties of our universe are accidental and uncalculable. In addition, we must believe in the existence of many other universes. But we have no conceivable way of observing these other universes and cannot prove their existence. Thus, to explain what we see in the world and in our mental deductions, we must believe in what we cannot prove.

That means no such luxuries as corpse identification, death certificates or even a prayer for the dead. What’s important right now, is to worry about the survivors, especially those still trapped, the injured, the starving and the homeless.
The term “imagination” in what I take to be its truest sense refers to a mental faculty that some people have used and thought about with the utmost seriousness. The sense of the verb “to imagine” contains the full richness of the verb “to see.” To imagine is to see most clearly, familiarly, and understandingly with the eyes, but also to see inwardly, with “the mind’s eye.” It is to see, not passively, but with a force of vision and even with visionary force. To take it seriously we must give up at once any notion that imagination is disconnected from reality or truth or knowledge. It has nothing to do either with clever imitation of appearances or with “dreaming up.” It does not depend upon one’s attitude or point of view, but grasps securely the qualities of things seen or envisioned.
A centipede that lived 45 million years ago exhibits perfect characteristics that are indistinguishable from those of modern-day specimens. If living specimens provide no evidence that evolution ever happened, if no evidence of any intermediate form has ever been unearthed, this shows that the fossil record refutes the theory of evolution. As in all other branches of science, the theory of evolution has been completely discredited by the fossil record as revealed by paleontology. Many evolutionists admit the truth of this, as does Stephen Jay Gould:
Osip Mandelstam was perhaps the most singular of all the geniuses who flourished amidst the chaos of revolutionary Russia. Raised in St Petersburg by Jewish parents, he was one of the young modernists who sought to revolutionise Russian poetry in the first two decades of the twentieth century, by replacing the over-elaborate language and cliched imagery of nineteenth century trends like Romanticism and Symbolism with work that was both crisply phrased and elliptical. From the start of his career, though, Mandelstam had a fiercely idiosyncratic understanding of the modernist mission.

Well, life is, and should be,
Even slightly wider shots, like the one forming Sarpina and Lorelei’s dinner scene, seem generous. Lorelei despises the police captain, but needs his sympathy to save Marion’s life. She knows what that will cost her. Sarpina wants the formality of a meal first, and so they sit at the near edges of a table corner, amidst a pile of food and drink, bisected by a tall white candle. The candle is their boundary line and whenever Sarpina leans forward we sense violation. This whole scene feels crowded, overfull—and finally overwrought, as the drunken Sarpina loses patience and lunges. The rape sequence that follows is physical for the time, with Lorelei failing to wilt as most silent-film women would, and Sarpina not quite getting the upper hand most mustachioed villains could count on. Stately meal and explosive violence become one piece; rich, thick image-making, prepared by the thinnest storytelling. I accepted it, and then enjoyed it as part of Chalice’s unapologetic visual melody. An opera, without the vocal rewards, would be no less shallow.

The first ‘chapter’ is called the Prologue (which means it isn’t actually a ‘chapter’ but whatever). It takes place back in the day when Stormwind had just finished being rebuilt (which I say happened in Year 20. Nothing seems to be entirely clear on that). Creme is a young girl, around 5 or so, and her mother, Elise, is taking her to Stormwind to the planned celebration/collection of payment for the workers (Elise is collecting her late-husband’s wages). However, things end up badly when the workers learn there is no payment and riots begin. Elise is killed in these riots, leading off to a very depressing start.

(CNSNews.com) – An analysis based on U.S. Census Bureau data by the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) shows that the average unemployment rate for teens ages 16 to 19 in the District of Columbia was 50.1 percent as of June 2011. This corresponds with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showing that for D.C. the annual average unemployment rate for teens in 2010 was 49.8 percent.

Prior to my tonsillectomy, I had to have a History and Physical in order to be cleared for surgery. When this happened, the head nurse (hee hee...'head' nurse) called me and was, frankly, alarmed at my results. My Triglycerides were around 620 or so. She was stunned. Let's just say that she said 'I've never seen a number this high. Are you sure you fasted?'

Ordinarily, elementary and secondary school experiences enforce study specifically toward the goals of passing exams. With fear and hope as tandem motivating factors, the shame of failure combines with the drive for timely completion. Between Chaucerian “fear fled with fury,” and Coleridge’s “work without hope draws nectar in a sieve,” potential joys in studies suffocate. Then, in the post-survival, comes the challenge of finding one’s own delight in learning that will last beyond time. For me, the steadily sweeter tastes evolved alongside my increased abilities to choose my own coursework- especially in graduate school.

“It’s a very elaborate, well done watercolor and that’s quite extraordinary in this period of Van Gogh’s oeuvre,” said Marije Vellekoop, the museum’s curator of prints and drawings. “Out of the blue, in the summer, in July, he makes a series of watercolors … with a lot of detail, but also very painterly, fluent.”

While the study examined the link between religion, compassion and generosity, it did not directly examine the reasons for why highly religious people are less compelled by compassion to help others. However, researchers hypothesize that deeply religious people may be more strongly guided by a sense of moral obligation than their more non-religious counterparts.

Thank you for your time,
Both Xunantunich and Cahal Pech provide great examples of what Lower Dover will look like soon enough. All of these Mayan sites had some interaction and contact with the Mayan capital of Tikal through the river systems of the Macal, Mopan, and Belize River. The Mopan and Macal Rivers meet just outside San Ignacio to form the Belize River at “Branch Mouth”. Lower Dover likely played a key role in regulating trade along the Belize River downstream.
Settlements, as well as the evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem are illegal and deeply unhelpful to efforts to bring a lasting peace to the Middle East conflict.
I have been reading this blog and she has been doing project 31, 31 random acts of kindess. She has inspired me!! So as a random act of kindess today I threw someone's laundry into the dryer with a dryer sheet and started it!! I hope it brightens thier day. This was a total unplanned act so I did not have my camara with me, infact I had to go back up to my apartment and write a note and then put it in the laundry basket. The kids were there with me and the LOVED it, maybe this will inspire them :-) I hope to do more random acts of kindness and would gladly take some suggestions!!!
I am very thankful that my career is advancing and I'm being kept busy. I love it, truly. But still, the last time I sat down to work just for me? I can't remember. It's always deadlines, class descriptions and article proposals.

Sarah lied to God when she said she didn’t laugh. I think she actually believed she didn’t laugh. Sarah did not deny her thoughts, only her actions. Sarah didn’t care what went on inside her mind and spirit. She only cared that others perceived her as having her spiritual act together. How do we know? She only tried to hide the fleshly error, not the heart issue. No one knew how sarcastic she had grown towards the promises of God.

This year, for the first time, Del and I are doing something for others at Christmas. Sure, we donate to the bell-ringers and the pet charity at the pet store every year, but I wanted to do more. Thanks to a church that we recently attended, we have been connected with people in one of Kansas City's missions. The church will be serving Christmas dinner. While we won't be able to help serve, we will be providing pie and cookies. This helps me a lot. I bake cookies every year for work, and I have been slacking this year because of how I feel. But now I HAVE to. I can't let the people at the mission down. My plan is to split the cookies between work and the mission, and I know that I'll be making people happy.
I’ll stop whining now, just tell me you missed me.

My paternal grandmother was Italian and always made her own sauces, which I almost always do as well. Tonight I wanted to experiment and try something different. I don’t know what you could call this sauce, but to me it’s a vegan substitute for alfredo sauce or a fancy mac and cheese. I rarely measure anything, so I’ll try my best to give directions.

Seeing as it is unlocked Magnus flips the lid open and is blasted backwards (and knocked out) by a powerful warding glyph. Ignoring the smoking warforged his companions examine the contents of the chest. They find not one but two adamantine schema, both identical.

He said it now takes almost three years for an applicant to get a decision on a patent. "Our goal is to get that down to one year. But a key of that is allowing the patent examiners to talk with the innovators and inventors instead of just trading letters and correspondence or e-mails," Locke said.

Is that why we don’t talk about Jesus? Are we afraid we will be arrested? Is that why we don’t share the wonderful relationship we have with Him with our friends and those around us? We are afraid of being jailed and ridiculed by others or worse… are we afraid our sharing Jesus with others will mean He has less time for us or He will care less for us?

New Year's Eve - Every year we go to the Greek club for their New Year's Eve Dance with my in-laws. It is a great night, and really family friendly with lots of organised children's activities. It's great to be able to have a bit of a dance, some food, a few drinks, and still be able to spend NYE with the kids. The evening is not super dressy (no ball gowns or cocktail dresses here!) so I went for a navy and white jersey dress with navy and white espadrille sandals. Ignore the necklace in the pic - after seeing the pic I realised the necklace didn't look great, so swapped it out for some chunky faux pearls which looked much better. I am in love with the dress! It was a super bargain at Myer's Stocktake Sale, but it is so flattering I would happily have paid full price for it. I love how the navy pattern lightens towards the bottom - it adds interest and the darker parts minimise my heavier parts.

No man can baptize his fellow man into the Body of Christ. This can be done only by almighty God. However, it is true that the Faith cometh by hearing the Word of God and sinners cannot believe unless they hear and they cannot hear unless God’s saints go to them with the saving Gospel, to plant and water, so that God will give the increase, and add such as are being saved. (Romans 10:12-15, Acts 2:47). “And believers were the more added to the LORD.” (Acts 5:14).

After suffering someone else incredibly stressful morning trying to get my 5 ½ year old son dressed, I’ve come to the windup that there must be other families who go straight through the same dissatisfaction every morning. Most just wouldn’t believe that we have it dissimilar than whatever else who has young kids. When I’m talking to man about Jeremy, my stress shows but the explanation is too long so I don’t ordinarily elaborate. Their usual talk is “sounds like a typical 5 year old”. I guess I’ve grown used to that. What is harder is to hear from other population who are trying to be helpful that we have a “discipline problem.” They offer their typical guidance of how to reign a child in and get them to behave.
Don't get me wrong--I love men. LOVE! They are fucking awesome. But it's not lost on me that they're ultimately running the show. And guess what? Men aren't so keen on seeing other men half naked.

Today I'm continuing with my French Week in celebration of a whole bunch of recent and future events, one being featured at the 'The Decorating Forum' this week. Once again thanks to Julie-Ann and all the readers who nominated my blog and a big welcome to my new readers.

I think I have become a little gentler on others and myself. I made an unconventional choice, and I feel more openness to others who make unconventional choices. There are a million ways to live, many of which I haven’t chosen yet, but certainly I don’t know the future. I never dreamed I would take a trip for 14 months around the world. I’m sure plenty of people thought me a little crazy and irresponsible. It was the right choice for me. So – whatever to those people. And I am working on being less judgemental of others. We all have our own challenges and rough roads, poor choices and regrets. I don’t need to heap my foolishness or scorn on top of the climb for someone else. Keep yours off mine too. Being out of the loop of gossip within a circle made me appreciate more how very pointless and damaging it all is. I’m sure I’ll slip and I know I already have, but at least I have turned my face toward a different direction.
I am having trouble imagining going back to work. I don't want to use up all of my savings, and even if I did I would still have to work again eventually.

In 2003 I was living in Canberra, working hard, studying harder, and spending waaaay too much time emailing and writing old fashioned letters to Alex, the perfect-on-paper man of my dreams. One day, I found myself sitting in a Belgian Beer Cafe in Perth, with my best mate, Alison, and we plotted a plan to go to Europe together in the summer, when I finished my degree. Al and I share a love of many things, Camper shoes being one of them. European culture and history being another. I knew she would love Belgium, and Evelyne. I organised to go to Cologne to meet up with Alex, of course, and was so excited. I could barely concentrate on my exams, and was flying out the week they finished.

Which means that this transition is going to be hard, with him going to live with someone new. And that’s why I need to share one more bit of info with you….His name’s not Reggie. I don’t know what made me do it, but when I dropped him off at the shelter, I told them his name was Reggie. He’s a smart dog, he’ll get used to it and will respond to it, of that I have no doubt but I just couldn’t bear to give them his real name. For me to do that, it seemed so final, that handing him over to the shelter was as good as me admitting that I’d never see him again. And if I end up coming back, getting him, and tearing up this letter, it means everything’s fine.

Of course, it is a bit of a leap from perceiving daily life as delusory to embracing an ancient cosmology that specifies a false god, a True God, a malevolent pantheon of Archons, and a hieros gamos (divine marriage) of Christ and Sophia. Unless one is in the market for a ready-made dramatic cast of spiritual entities to believe in, the Gnostic myths best serve as metaphors for one’s dilemma – and, in fact, that may have been the role they played for the early Gnostics, as well.
A local broker, however, had a more pragmatic view, saying that although Sime Darby was keen to venture into high-end development, it did not necessarily want to obtain everything at one go via a general offer, which would have been a much riskier proposition.

We spent the afternoon at the Dubai Autodrome because Paul’s boss Omran and his brother were racing and we thought it would be an interesting experience. Just driving out there was an experience in itself. It is far from the city and is surrounded by construction. We missed the turnoff due to vague signage. We had to go quite a ways to an enormous ROUNDABOUT (my favorite thing) and come back to a different turnoff. Then we wondered around driving generally toward the grandstand which we could see at that point. When we got to what looked like the entrance to the grandstand, it looked deserted except for a few cars parked out in the street and on the sidewalk. We found a parking lot, which was a significant walk away (through construction), so we decided to join the cars parked on the street right outside the entrance.
I appreciate my life, and don’t get me wrong I think this world is a great place, but humanity has sent it astray, we live within a multifaceted society and people’s opinions greatly differ from one and other I suppose each of us hold our own contrarian beliefs. I believe the greatest impediment of humanity is greed; in today’s world people rely on semantics; greed is misguidedly considered need. We as a nation have demoralized our beliefs in order to make way for “better things” the world is officially in a state of mass hysteria; although violence is not always displayed; people often share the same train of thought, the same hunger for perfection, the very same “need” for more. This “need” has often times resulted with insurgency, people are constantly trying to over throw the “higher power” although the world has went through significant changes we still lie within a hierarchy. Life is separated into different sects, in a simplistic point of view there are those who hold power and those who do not. Those who initially have power always want more, and those without it are constantly trying to obtain it.
As she drove through the real countryside of starving and angry peasants in rags with the curtains of her carriage tightly drawn, Marie Antoinette was happy to ignore reality in favour of the gilded fantasy she had created, and may even, in those final days before the fall, have begun to believe that her make believe world was reality, and that the other world, the one outside was the fake.
So now I have to wait until March 14th for the excitement to start up again, I guess I'll survive!
I realized that being drunk with alcohol removes inhibitions and reveals your true sin nature. Alcohol removes all the “rules” one has learned about behaving around other people and allows one to say what they want, take what they want and do what they want. The human sin nature is ugly and repulsive to God; it is the opposite of His character. We were created for fellowship with God, and any sin in our lives breaks fellowship with God. When we take action that causes us to sin without any restraint we are keeping ourselves from God and from who we were created to be. God’s plan is to refine, purify and sanctify us so that we can become more like Him.
Let me know if you try it!

This book is all about worms and decomposer's habitat. It has an easy reading and good pictures with some good facts notes in it. The way the contents are exposed is simple and dynamic for kids. Firstly, a definition of habitat is offered but, the whole book will explain how decomposers live on dead organisms and the importance of this for plants and for the environment. It will show different animals and explain main characteristics of them and how they interact with their habitat. Finally, the book invites the readers to make an activity and a section on glossary and resources is provided.
Picking out those three actors should in no way diminish the accomplishments of the rest of the cast which includes memorable turns by Andie MacDowell, Bruce Davison, Julianne Moore, Matthew Modine, Anne Archer, Fred Ward, Chris Penn, Lili Taylor, Robert Downey Jr., Madeleine Stowe, Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits and still others.
Inside those books, he said, is information about “the beginning of the collapse of the human race,” which will take place during the next two decades.

So glad I made that change. It gave so much dimension to the room, plus it was such a quick project I won't feel bad if my ever-changing hormones change their mind (because they have a mind of their own) about it in a few months. :) I think it's here to stay though.
I can't not pick my dear little estranged kitty. She lives on a different location because I'm allergic (sob) but I get to see her now and then. She remembers me every time, and that always makes me happy.
The December issue of many vintage magazines have special Christmas hairdo instructions, not surprising given in many ways people apparently dressed up more (or better!) in those days than we do now. I'm going to cheat a bit and post a few pages from Hair Secrets from December 1970, so just past the end of the decade but a very nice how to do typical aspects of fancy Christmas styles. Take a look:

At least I was comfortable on the train. Take it from someone who has done his fair share of cross-country traveling: riding by train can be so relaxing. With a bus, you've got people packed in close together, in seats that sometimes have fixed armrests, with people yacking on their cellphones or scolding screaming babies, and if you're big like me there's never enough legroom, and getting enough sleep is always a tenuous proposition at best. I could do an entire post on this.
Operation Odyssey Dawn: beginning in the middle of things; or the start of a ten-year quest, with the god of seas and earthquakes against it from the outset, with lotus-eating, cannibalism, a bag of wind, the turning of men into swine, sirens, drownings, cunning speech and disguises to come.
I’ve tried the numbing myself approach to everything. I can’t do it. There’s no fucking control. After you find something that works, this specific addiction, it starts to drive you. Takes over everything. Until it’s the only thing that really matters. You can try to act like other things really matter. But as with any addiction, it’s the only thing that truly matters. Your own little escape from the real. Maybe that’s what makes society work so well. That little fucking sense of inner peace people get when they give in to the fear and feel “normal” once again. Must be some sort of high. I wouldn’t know much about that whatsoever. Such matters don’t remotely concern me the way they should juxtaposed with popular views.
That said... I sincerely hope that ANYONE who is against these bills will vote against EVERY SINGLE senator and representative who voiced support for and/or put their names to these atrocities. You can as cute as you want with your blogs and website today, but it means nothing if you don't follow through the next time these assholes are put for re-election.

Now for those of you thinking “awww, poor girl. He slept with her and then blows her off the next day…” Just stop. Stop for a second, and listen to the texts. If you JUST saw someone the night before, it is really not necessary to see them the next day. I don’t think it was unreasonable of Kevin to not want to hang with her. Lots of people don’t want to get that involved so early on in a relationship. Kevin was probably just trying to keep his distance. I think it’s good to remain a little distant when you first begin to date someone: whether you are looking to get in a relationship with them or not. If you are planning on dating someone, then I definitely wouldn’t sleep with them too early on. If you never wanna see someone again, then by all means fuck them whenever.

Now, I’ve realised how much I’ve been overreacting.
home to my parents,
I remember once, she was teaching a database class, a topic where she was expert and my knowledge was skimpy. Microsoft had just released its first database program. Students were clamouring for it. The program was full of bugs and constantly crashing. I went into the classroom to assist Kathy. She was practically distraught. She wanted to cancel the class. In her mind, if the program crashed while she was teaching, the students would blame her personally, not Microsoft, who was releasing software not ready for prime time, nor the University of Oregon Portland Center, who was offering a dubious and unready program to satisfy student demands.
last week, i promised some more shots of the restaurant project i've been working on...here they are! i'm actually still doing a little work there, but here is some of the other stuff i have done. the restaurant used to be eno (for you atlantans), near the fox, and they totally reinvented it, and now it's called 5th street cafe. i was working with a very creative design team, which was wonderful. it's nice to be around other creative thinkers, and it was a blast to draw on chalkboards all day (which is what i'm doing again today!).

Now the rule applies to an “official” which is defined in Article 1.1 of the SFA’s Articles of Association as “any person having a function or duty or position involving authority or trust within a club … including any such person who is able to exercise control over the majority of the board of any such club (whether or not that person is himself intimated to the Registrar of Companies as holding the office of a director)”.
The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from death, lives in me, then He who raised Christ from death will also give life to my mortal body by the presence of His Spirit in me. God’s Spirit joins Himself to my spirit to declare that I am a child of God. Since I am a child of God, I will possess the blessings God keeps for His people, and I will also posses with Christ what God has kept for Him; for if I share Christ suffering, I will also share His Glory! Amen!

Promising was an understatement. It was delicious! And just as satisfying was the fact that I prepped and cooked it in a very reasonable amount of time. About 30 minutes, I think? I don’t know – I chatted with my roommate a bit and still turned this dinner out quickly.
The weather was thick on the coast last night, not only interfering, it is believed, with. the wireless communication, from the liner to Sable island, but probably with its rate of progress to New-York, whither it is heading.

in the last week there has been a payday and many reasons to celebrate. So, I am afraid I have to admit, I have spent quite a few occasions in the last 7 days partaking of a fine and tasty beverage in a good pub. Here are some details of my excursion into Tuesday temulency.
Maybe it was just an off day (or week), but I’ve been feeling like my recipes/posts have been less than awesome. There was a sense of “going with the flow” experimenting and naïve optimism in the beginning of this blog. Now it seems to have progressed into wanting perfection every time I take something out of the oven.
This month has been super jam-packed busy! So busy in fact I had to take time off from real world working just to keep up with what's going on at home! And speaking of jam-packed, I even packed jam. Not just the mango rosemary jam I promised and never delivered but good ol' fashioned strawberry jam. I tested two recipes and came back with the one I liked the most! Oddly enough, that was not the country 'use lemons' recipe that you slow cook. The more delicious, thicker, pinker lovelier batch came from the back of the Jamsetta packet. Go figure! (If anybody can tell me where to get local pectin, please post!)
Mrs. ZZUB got to say goodbye to him too. She also rubbed his head and talked with him. Told him he'd been a good boy. And for the last few minutes of his life it was how it once had been: Stafford and his mom and dad.
Congrats to all! :-)
Continuity Errors. I’m sure many people have already twigged the complete retelling of Steven Moffat’s first short story in the form of this Christmas special. Continuity Errors was a brilliant short story in which The Doctor needs to check out a book from a galactic library. The book will help in stop a war. Unfortunately, the book is in a restricted area and the librarian won’t let him through. While not written in first person, the narration follows the librarian, giving her perspective on everything that happens. She never leaves the library, and The Doctor repeatedly meddles in her past, attempting to change her personality to such a degree as to finally allow him to check out the book. A Christmas Carol is the same story, just with more urgency. Now, to a degree I don’t mind that Moffat would retell this story. It is a short story in a long out-of-print collection. Why not put a new spin on it and re-release it into a more permanent format? The only problem is that he has been mining this particular story for virtually everything he has written. This story has a line that declares monster are afraid of The Doctor, a great line, actually. This line has been repeated in The Girl in the Fire Place and The Eleventh Hour. A planetary library re-appears in Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead. In that same story we have the introduction of River Song, an smart-talking archaeologist who bears a slight resemblance to Bernice Summerfield, a companion originally created by Paul Cornell, who also appears in Continuity Errors. If you can track down the story, it is certainly worth a read because it fits with what the New Adventures line was doing with The Seventh Doctor at the time, and it is fascinating as an indicator for how Steven Moffat would approach Doctor Who when he began to write for it. Sadly, I think this is one of the more irritating aspects of the Moffat era, the recycling of material. A detailed analysis of Steven Moffat’s stories will make recurring elements glaringly obvious. The Doctor talks to children . . . a lot. This is somewhat new. Not only that, he has a tendency to talk to little girls and later meet them when they have grown up, only to find that they are in love with him (Girl in the Fireplace, The Eleventh Hour). We have Sally Sparrow helping a temporally displaced Doctor get back to his TARDIS (How I Spent My Summer Vacation, Blink). We have a dead character continuing to communicate to haunting effect (Silence in the Library, Time of the Angels). We also have a race of aliens who dress in suits, are bald, and exist just out of the vision of humans. These aliens follow us and feed off us in some way. (The Floof in Corner of the Eye, The Silence). Perhaps we could more accurately predict the outcomes of Steven Moffat stories if we study his back catalogue in greater detail. We shouldn’t even limit ourselves to Doctor Who. There is a scene in Jekyll where Thomas Jackman talks to Mr. Hyde via pre-recorded videotape. Quite similar to the Easter eggs on Sally Sparrow’s DVDs in Blink. So while I don’t begrudge Moffat drawing more heavily from his out-of-print story, doing so once more makes him look a bit like a one-trick pony.

Convicted! Convicted! Convicted! (It rattles around in my head like an annoying parrot’s voice.) That is what I am today. And believe it or not I’m actually very thankful for it…parrot voice and all. In reading Cheri’s blog today, there were two things that really hit home. So much so that I confessed one of my “sins” in the comments section of her post. The other one…well it boils down to what my Father is telling me to do. He’s whispered in the quiet recesses of my brain, (in much the same way that Kevin Costner hears the “voice” in “Field of Dreams”) “Go the distance….” But unlike Kevin’s character I don’t have to figure it out; I know exactly what He means.
El Salvador’s executive office is not the only branch of government demonstrating some real autonomy of late. As evidenced by its decision to do away with the PDC and PCN parties – against objections from the AL – the judiciary has shown a real independent streak as well.
"This is yet more proof that independent publishing and print-on-demand is legitimate and successful," says Bob Young, CEO of Lulu.com. "The Internet is truly the great equalizer and gives everyone the chance to publish, especially people such as Diane Klumb, whose award-winning, best-selling book would have never seen the light of day without Lulu."

Or, perhaps, is it because Kasztner himself was Jewish, and Schindler was not? I think, personally, that this is the reason. Schindler, as an Aryan, German (kind of), SS member and war-profiteer … for him to go out of his way to save the lives of 1500 people is an amazing and touching accomplishment. He was not expected to save the lives of hunted Jews. But Kasztner, as a member of the Jewish people, a member of the Jewish council, who without the influence and financial capital he was privy to, would have been deported to Auschwitz along with the rest of his community … for him to charge people for their safety perhaps is perhaps unforgivable. However, I would argue that the 1500 people who didn’t have to pay anything make up for that sin. Can value be assigned to human life? Just how much is one worth? I have to tell you, that if the Holocaust 2.0 broke out tomorrow in London, Ontario, I would have zero issue in emptying my bank account to someone who could help get me out.
The British government must be deaf, dumb and blind not to see what their generous welfare system is breeding. Most radical Muslim leaders there are on welfare - doesn't this ring some very loud bells somewhere in the hallowed halls of parliament? Idle hands are the devil's tools and boy they don't make them bigger than this mobs. Just have a good look at the picture below and see what the British tax payer is supporting. I know I wouldn't be very happy to find out, were I living in the UK, that my hard earned money was supporting these thugs. I can only wonder how people living there must feel.

I feel as if I often repeat myself. I've said all the things I could say that I have felt and ever felt. Everyday is a new day, and I'm OK with having good days as they are more often now then they once were. There is still a push of guilt when I have a succession of good days, but I try not to beat myself up over it. I have some projects I plan to start again. I started the memory box idea, but now have decided to make some adjustments to the legacy left by Savanna. I don't want to share too much as I plan to have an 'unveiling' soon. As I've stayed away from this place due to the extremely busy schedule and the fear of repetition there is one thing I have realized. I love this space. I love what it represents. I love what it says. I love where it has taken me. I love the people that I have 'met.' With that being said.. I will be taking a bit of a hiatus. Although it seems that I already have, there has been an underlaying pressure when I think about blogging. So, to relieve myself of that pressure, I will be taking a leave of absence. I don't know how long, but I know for certain it's not forever. And who knows, taking that pressure off of myself, I may find here back again before you know it.

Their job is to reassure and soothe the Western public, in particular the symbolic analysts of the media and the academy.

Take it from me that Islam is rational and enlightened, much more so than Christianity or Judaism.”

Of course NAMA didn’t cause the financial crisis and is tasked with addressing an element of the crisis. So that differentiates NAMA from its borrowers. On the other hand, some developers with non-recourse loans or ring-fenced corporate limited liability have the option of telling NAMA to get lost whilst they move onto other projects that might keep them in the lifestyle to which they were at one time accustomed. That’s the uneasy truth.

It seems now internationally accepted that design galleries are participating art fairs which used to be dominated by more fine art-focused galleries. One of these new risers at Art Geneve was teo jakob. The booth was large and beautifully arranged with new designs and reproduction of old ones. Their catalogue was filled with modern day classics; Eames, Henningsen, Noguchi…to name a few. As amazing as they look, however, mass-produced reproduction of 50-year old designs look a bit sad probably because they lack a history of themselves (not the history of the archetype but the one of each piece). They also left me with a question: are we living on the great debt to the past? Of course these designs still have a strong appeal to the current taste (in other words, that’s why they are “classics”). But would would be the next Eames? Can we only find out after 50 years?
I noticed in Julie's layouts that she used some mixed media on them, and given that I have started to do the same I thought it would be interesting to add some moulding paste , gesso, gauge and paint all at once. Why not right ? LOL!

It's strange when she nails it. And she blames it all on Uranus. (insert joke here) I don't see how travel is going to be possible, I can't even take a weekend day off or I'll get behind.

Perhaps then, I'll be able to appreciate the beauty of the white stuff again.
Our donor and his boyfriend had returned from their trip but had been invited up to a mutual friends cabin to go camping for the weekend…the same weekend I was ovulating. Luckily, they know what we’ve been up to and they invited us along so that we could continue to try that weekend. I was grateful that it was much more of a house without cable or internet in the woods than a real rustic cabin and I could be pretty relaxed and comfortable for the weekend. We realize that the guys are doing us a favor by working with us so we really try our best to be accommodating, but this whole “let’s-go-camping-AND-try-to-make-a-baby” road show is really getting old. We asked to please really not have to do it again. Nonetheless, we survived it and got a few tries in that weekend.

Yellow also has it’s useful and down sides. Yellow is the color of caution (as in the yellow traffic light) or hazards. Yellow is sometimes associated with illness (jaundice) and a lack of courage (yellow-bellied). There are cultures where yellow corresponds with jealousy, avarice, dishonesty, and weakness. Yellow and green were both used to symbolize the devil and death during the Middle Ages. Yellow is the color of mourning in Egypt. It is the color of courage in Japan.
That didn't last long. After a week or so, we were all getting on each others nerves. The double wide was put together though we still had no utilities. We decided we'd make do. So we moved out to the property, and essentially camped in our house for about two weeks. We cooked with camp stoves and grills. Anything cold had to be kept in coolers, and we bought a lot of ice. Water was hauled in with camping jugs. Really, and truly it wasn't bad. It felt good to be out on the property, and if it wasn't for all the unpacking and organizing, it would have felt like a mini vacation.

I hesitantly began trimming the hairs from the back of his head. When I was finished he took the clippers and shortened his sideburns. Eventually he trimmed what little facial hair he’d been able to grow. He then paused, evaluating his hairdo in the mirror. He was visibly unsatisfied. “I didn’t make the side even enough. I’m gonna have to shave them off.” I looked on in horror as he balded the sides of his head and left the top close in length to how it was before. “How’s it look?” Jack inquired. “Actually, not that bad,” I responded with surprise. Jack smiled again. “I would have left one side unshaven, but I didn’t want to be that pretentious douche you always see in the Mission.”

My new found zest for purging my crowded mind into the blogosphere has proven to be quite refreshing. However, sleep deprived as I am these days, I am finding one crippling flaw in this recent creative writing exercise. I now have a new earworm in the form of obsessing over how flawed my writing is. I find that after every new post, I toss and turn in bed dissecting the piece in my thoughts and wondering how, how, how, can I ever have a career as a writer when I succeed in only producing trite little trinkets of indulgent observation. A perfect example is my last entry. How could I have possibly compared Nanny McPhee to Flow? There are so many flaws in that analogy I can't seem to stop thinking about them all.

Soul Hunter refers to the protagonist, Talos. An appropriately complex lead character, he's a former apothecary of the Night Lords legion, now a vision-tortured prophet serving a Daemon-possessed captain aboard a ramshackle vessel full of battle-brothers that despise one another and enslaved humans forced to dwell in the perpetual darkness the Night Lords favour.
So, anyways, here she is in all her glory! She actually fits perfectly in the corner I need a sink in(speaking of which- my kitchen plans have changed since my last kitchen post- I'll have to update with a new post sometime)

Then when I turned twenty, I went through a resurgence of faith. I read and carried the Bible with me all day long. I studied and highlighted and thought constantly of God. I was a prophet in my own mind and spoke my thoughts at anytime. Then around 24 another situation came up and I was back to that time again.

Next came the boys. I loved laying with each of them for just a minute since Audrey was still awake downstairs in the saucer, watching "Baby Praise." Reading a quick Bible story. Gazing up at Isaac's tent that he put on top of his bed (it is still crazy to me that he sleeps in his bed, IN a tent!) Then, moving to tuck in Aaron. I love that my big strong boy still begs for me to rub his back and his head at night.
Not to mention that some girl Adriana is missing me since we last spoke, my penis is not big enough and there are steroids to make my life better.. this is the problem with having a masculine name that I get targeted by all the male related topics too.

I'd love it if you'd all take a look at it, not just to see the gifts available, but to let me know WHAT you all want to see. Think I need more magnets? Should I have different products for sale? Let me know, I want to hear what my customers/fans want so I can make it for them.
With this Convention, France, Germany, Britain, Canada and a host of other nations with strong creative industries are able to withstand American creep in their local markets, and maintain and celebrate their own identities and cultural heritage. The language of “cultural diversity” has thus been appropriated largely to preserve the audio-visual and other creative industries of countries of the north in their trade battle with America.
Secondly, JustUs has gotten it's first two festival acceptances! Miguel Rodriguez of the Monster Island Resort podcast (and one of the nicest people I've met!) accepted my film to his event which is called Horrible Imaginings. It takes place on the weekend of November 4 in San Diego and last night, the Canton Film Festival in my birthplace of Canton, Ohio, accepted JustUs AND the music video Sine to their festival! And "Sine" just played the Black Rock Film Festival in Nevada over Labor Day weekend! That city doesn't exist outside of Burning Man!

The p-mail parts were another fun touch. Christian first makes contact with Marigold via pigeon, since Ed kept a pair of pigeons for sending messages of his own. And the cave they shared was just across the river from the castle where Marigold lived. Some of the messages are long enough that they are broken up into pieces in order to fit on the birds' legs. They are shown in order, but the book shows the breaks between pieces of paper.

If any person arrived at the age of discretion profanely curse or swear or get drunk in public, he shall be fined by a justice one dollar for each offense. Ok, to me, this means that you can only get fined $1 if you get drunk in public. Why aren’t more people drinking at public events? This is very disappointing. Every street party now can be a drunken affair. Just hand a cop a $1 and party away.
What ticks me off is when people are instantly angry or send hateful e-mails without first trying to understand where I am coming from. I am always open to people contacting me, and using my blog as a forum for a respectful, thoughtful dialogue.

Where I grew up, we put mufflers on cars to make them quieter, we didn't try to make them noisier.

I chose a watercolor painting as the object for the audio video project. To make it interesting, I took close-up, detailed images that show the brush strokes and the texture of the paper to reveal the artists’ style of painting. To obtain the images, a video camera was first used. But my use of a flip camera resulted in blurry images and shaky pans even with the camera attached to a tripod. Instead, a digital camera was used to obtain the same video camera effects that the video editin
Now for the fun part, how does Lifetime’s 7 Days of Sex rate? It wasn’t the worst thing I’ve ever watched on TV, but I also probably won’t watch it again unless I’m in bed waiting to fall asleep and there’s nothing else on. Therefore, I give it the NIV rating (Nyquil Induced Viewing): Perfect for that late night television sleep timer.
Now before anyone freaks out in the comments section, I'm not saying that all or even most priests and monks are gay. It stands to reason, though, that the Church was ironically one of the only refuges for gay people to avoid sleeping with the opposite sex and living a lie. It may be that the ritual of adelphopoiesis was a way to bond two men in a lifelong relationship that was superficially religious in nature, while everyone in the monastery was giving the pair a sly wink, knowing what was really going on.

I'd like to think that we met through fate. Yes, fate, that indescribable relevance of all events resulting to something of great significance. Some think it's coincidence, but my mind chooses to differ.
Cooking torrijas was an interesting experience because we were using Loli’s kitchen and supplies and we had never cooked in Spain before. Lighting the burners for example required using a lighter and putting your hand right next to where the gas came out. After several attempts I had Loli do it, instead of filling the house with gas. In addition Shannon and I had never deep-fried something the way that the Spaniards deep-fry. Therefore we added a generous amount of oil to the pan, to which Loli added two-inches-deep more of oil. Now this is what I’m calling healthy! Through the various steps we finally figured out how to make the torrijas come out well since we couldn’t soak the bread in the milk or in the batter too long, otherwise it would become too soggy and break. The best way to describe it was that there were too many cooks in the kitchen. Taking over someone else’s territory – in this case Shannon and I taking over Loli’s kitchen – caused disruption and the necessity for her to intervene. Consequently spoons with batter fell on the ground, oil spattered from the pan onto my skin and final products sometimes burned. As with many things in Spain, I’ve learned from the experience.

Watching her sleep under the sheen of early morning light, he can't remember what happened the night before. He can see the faint outline her body makes under the sheets; shadows fall dark in the concave of her waist, sunlight splashes against the curve of her hip. She is curled towards him, her head tucked under his chin. Lying together on his mattress, he tries to remember her name.
Driving back across the street to work over lunch yesterday, my car was making a clunking sound. When I exited the vehicle, I noticed my ear buds had been hanging out the door, clunking between the road and my car for two blocks. It's hard to see, but they're beat to hell, and they're missing the rubber part that goes in your ear. They came with extras, so I popped new ones on, and lo and behold, they still work! If that's not a convincing argument for these $10 ear buds by SkullCandy, I don't know what is.
Strengths: This is definitely an adult novel, and it is a brilliant continuation of the Holmes chronicles, embracing Doyle's style in both style and theme. Horowitz has clearly read and researched in order to do justice to this character.
It means that our original expeditions are changed a bit, and also the expedition teams, plus I have a maximum of two funded places for my OPG guys per expedition, and that makes choosing who should go on expedition really hard as they are all amazing. Its also hard to know that some of them are wealthier and will likely have more opportunities to travel in life, whereas some of our guys will never have such an opportunity to visit another country, but it seems unfair to choose them based on financial background and opportunity and goes against everything we stand for, in making things fair for everyone. I’d hate it if we choose our refugees and IDPs over other kids who have maybe put in several hours a week on activities, just because they will have chance in the future. I also don’t want it to be based on age or ability in English, or to exclude people who are naturally quieter and therefore overshadowed by more vocal students, nor do I want just the scientists to go. Deciding is so hard. For some kids there is no doubt in my mind, and where there is no competition it is easy, but when you have ten kids equally competitive for one place, it gets hard, especially when emotionally involved and when you know how disappointed they will be. I feel quite mixed emotions right now, on the one hand I’m relieved and happy that any of them can go, and happy to have so many great kids to choose from, but equally sad not to be able to take them all. But if this goes well, there will be ample opportunity for us to take them next year, and all of them have asked us to start up a new project for them for next year as they wish to continue on project, so that is really positive.

Cain has announced that he is suspending his campaign because of the barrage of sexual harassment and marital infidelity claims that have been levied against him in the last few weeks. Cain made the decision after having had a long conversation with his wife and several girlfriends. Final score? Girlfriends 1, Cain 0. Cain learned that it is very difficult to profess to being a devout family man when you are accused of a life of lewd sexual behavior by several woman who are not your wife. At least Cain will not have to submit to that lie detector test which he volunteered for last month.

Synchronised is bidding to become only the second horse to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the John Smith’s Grand National in the same season following Golden Miller, who completed the Cheltenham-Aintree double in 1934. Bred by owner J P McManus’ wife Noreen, Synchronised is by Sadler’s Wells out of the Bob Back mare Mayasta, a multiple scorer on the Flat and over hurdles and the first winner that A P McCoy rode for his now-retained owner in April, 1996. He made his career debut for trainer Jonjo O’Neill at Chepstow on February 14, 2008, finishing second in a maiden hurdle, and followed up with a soft ground victory in a similar contest at Towcester a month later. The gelding raced four times during the 2008/2009 season, winning twice: after defeating Cashel Blue at Wincanton in January, 2009, he emphasised his potential with a neck verdict over Tazbar in a Pertemps Hurdle qualifier at Haydock in February, 2009. Synchronised switched to steeplechasing for the 2009/10 campaign and won his first two starts over fences, defeating Blue Gun on soft ground at Market Rasen in November and then seeing off Giles Cross in a portentous heavy ground stamina test at Chepstow that December. After suffering a reversal at Fontwell in January, 2010, Synchronised bounced back to land a gruelling renewal of the Listed John Smith’s Midlands Grand National at Uttoxeter in March of the same year. He reverted to hurdles for his first two outings of the 2010/2011 season as he warmed up for the Coral Welsh National in January, 2011, when he stayed on strongly for a two and three quarter-length verdict over Giles Cross. Synchronised headed back to Uttoxeter for another crack at the John Smith’s Midlands Grand National in March, 2011, and he ran well in defeat to come home third under top-weight, but he ended his campaign with a disappointing effort the following month as he was pulled up in the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse. He started the current season with two appearances over hurdles, finishing seventh in a Pertemps Hurdle qualifier at Aintree on October 23 and staying on strongly to take third in a valuable fixed-brush handicap hurdle at Haydock on November11. Synchronised returned to fences to record a first Grade One success in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on December 28, when he stayed on well for a convincing eight-and-a-half length victory over Rubi Light. He improved on that run on his latest start in the Grade One Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup at Cheltenham on March 16 as he rallied gamely to beat The Giant Bolster by two and a quarter lengths, with defending champion Long Run a further three-quarters of a length back in third. Race Record: Starts: 19; Wins: 9; 2nd: 1; 3rd: 3; Win & Place Prize Money: £510,775

It's important to understand that the supposedly "prudent" economies of France, Germany, South Korea and Canada are just as heavily indebted as the U.S. or "drowning in debt" nations such as Italy. In the long view, is Germany's load of 284% of GDP really that different from Italy's 313%? Yes, the mix of debt is different, but the point is that all of Europe, and indeed the developed world, is overloaded with debt: state, bank and private.

I bought this around the first term of university but I hardly ever wore it as I don't like my arms. But I wore it out the other night and I loved it.

The colour also makes me happy!
So, here it is, the big news:
“We’re learning a lot about planets that are close to their stars, but that is not the full picture. We also want to know about systems where planets are very far out. By considering near-, far- and mid-range, we can get a complete picture of planet formation,” University of Florida astronomer Aaron Boley told Discovery News.

While this all sounds very playful and not entirely academic, let’s remember that playing IS the way young children learn best. Whether it’s enjoying a new culture through its music, traditions, and clothing at a playful luau, or watching a square bubble wand form circular bubbles no matter how they blow them (then asking why this continuously happens), playing is how children learn new things. In a way, playing is children’s form of work (think about how tired you are after a day’s work, and how tired our kids can be after a full day at preschool – both are mentally and physically taxing!).
Are we not dealing with this because some nutcases are still denying that it happened?
That left five Cline statements: that Hudson had committed “misconduct . . . involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, and corruption”; that Hudson was guilty of “kidnapping the rights of victims and their families”; that Hudson had committed “intentional malicious conduct”; that “this Court is in total and complete violation of the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct”; and that Hudson needed to “acknowledge that your hands are covered with the blood of justice, and be ashamed.”

Reflecting on all this, I'm not quite sure what I can meaningfully say about the experience, yet I do feel the need to express it somehow. There's the ever-present chance that I could write an extended, convoluted post which could be summed up as I really don't have the words. Also, an account based on my own subjective experience feels like it would be indulgent: yet should I try to open it up into more large-scale observations then I think I would fall flat on my face.

This layout follows this weeks sketch from Nuts about sketches and fits with the theme of 'animals' from lasting memories.

That is all from me. Have a great week everyone.

The High Holy Days are followed by the pilgrimage and harvest festival of Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles), which commemorates the period in which the Israelites, according to tradition, dwelled in "tabernacles" or "booths" (Sukkot) while wandering in the wilderness after the Exodus. Because the holiday involves a ritual meal and the construction of a temporary and vulnerable shelter, it naturally lends itself to meditations on the theme of hunger and homelessness.

I suppose it must; otherwise, why would the advertisers continue to shell out money for it?

In about 20 minutes the bike was ready and I went for a test ride. The first thing I noticed is how much light the bike felt without all the gear changing paraphernalia. Whilst riding it also felt lighter and nimbler and more responsive, a bit quicker off the line and bit more ‘chuckable’ through traffic. There certainly seemed to be less effort lost in the drive line, and that makes a certain amount of sense because the chain doesn’t wind serpentinely around the shifter arm jockey wheels.
And while I am taken by Self's assessment that both forms, the novel and the symphony, seek to 'simultaneously enact the most complete possible world-in-words or world in notes, while also actualising the creative personality itself', in many other ways we're just not comparing like with like, as other commenters point out. Seems to me that the verbal nature of novels creates a cognitive relationship between the work and the reader fundamentally different from the relationship between music and the listener (although Self labours the point that music shares the novel's 'struggle for a narrative voice'). We can let music wash over us, we can receive it emotionally without feeling the simultaneous need to understand it intellectually. Furthermore, the novel is hitched to commercialism in a way that contemporary music (I think) isn't. As Marion Miller points out in the Guardian comments, it is publishers, rather than authors, who determine which kinds of novels reach the light of day, and inevitably they respond to this readerly need for clarity.

So there we are getting pointers from the Hulk, drunkenly trying to take it all in. The main strategy, which we had figured out fairly early in the season, was to try and take out the other team’s best players first. That way it is easier to pick off the weaklings at the end, the ones that can’t catch. Hopefully, if you are following this logic correctly, you’ve already figured out that this means that I am consistently the last one on my team left on the court. Hulk pointed out to me that the best thing to do in this situation is to back into a corner when it’s the other team’s turn to throw and go for a catch. It’s the only hope really, as my weak arm is never getting anybody on the other team out.

Patrick Gerard, Rector of the Universities of Paris, and Richelieu's Maire Novelli have finalized the binding agreements which endure for a period of thirty years; the Sorbonne remains as owner, in co-operation with with both the two local authorities, the Conseil Général of the Départment of Indre-et-Loire (who until recently covered the maintenance costs), and the Town and Communes of Richelieu. The Town & Communes will now take on the responsibility for these costs, as the Conseil Général has now ceased financial contributions - from the end of year 2012. It had shouldered these since former arrangements made in 2005.

I coloured the image with Copics and added loads of Stardust Stickles to the fish to make them gleam! I spent ages choosing background papers to tie in with my by/water/fishing theme, and I'm sorry I can't remember who made them.
Some time in the next week or so, I will post damage photos. I had a chance to survey and shoot damage inside a destroyed home in Aurora, Nebraska (and offered the shots to the Lincoln newspaper.) It's quite a heartwrenching thing, and it's difficult to understand the kinds of damage that tornadic winds can produce without seeing it yourself.
AYR reports that, contrary to previous statements, Bruce Ratner told shareholders in June that the arena would open in mid-2011, at the earliest. FCR's Bruce Bender, trying to spin, suggests groundbreaking would occur in the fall. It doesn't.

We have red and green colored clothing perfect for Christmas this year!
I don't feel like I can be truly honest about what I'm feeling like and that's hard. I've put a lot of effort into growing this blog and it isn't as private as it used to be. People I know in real life read what I write - although some deny it strongly which I will never understand - and that means I have to censor much of what I discuss here.
Businesses would prefer to give an employee a raise and add more tasks to the employees job scope than pay a minimum wage and be faced with arbitrary pay increases each time the government changes the law.
Here is my recipe, in all it’s estimated glory. Enjoy! And if you make it, please let me know how you liked it!!
Some have said it is strange that I still live in the same town that I grew up. Some would also say that it is strange that I attended a university in the same city I grew up. Some would say that it is really strange that I work at the university I attended in the city I grew up. I say that it’s just me being true to myself and a sense of personal pride.

Some of the distilleries, unhappy with this particular turn of events, now use plastic glasses. Sometimes you can't tell they're plastic until you have invested the time in line to get one. This disappoints the mob and makes it surly.
But yeah. The joke was mostly taking aim at Sarkozy because I don’t like him. Not on a personal level, as he might be a proper lad – small people with large noses often are – but he always seems like a prick politically. Being snide about the lack of British co-operation with a thing that would do nothing to help Britain was one thing that annoyed me, despite not really being bothered about my own country if I’m honest, but also just having to see his face on the news saying “yeah Angela” was pretty boring too. During his 5 year-until-now (that may still carry on), Sarkozy might as well have been that Angela Merkel woman, since they seem to be married or something. Except they’re not. Bants.
In this charming, poignant, and uproarious follow-up to Confessions of a Counterfeit Farm Girl, Susan McCorkindale chronicles the continuously harrowing journey of what happens when you leave the big city for the land of wide-open spaces.
I just love it and I think I have found a new passion. Tranferware! I have a few pieces but definitely will keep my eye out for more to go in my collection. One thought is to make this into a lovely sink for a powder room in our new one-day home. Hubby also came home with these:

I should make it clear what I’m actually talking about when I speak of community. I suppose, though the word community can encompass a huge range of things, I think of three primary immediate community: your neighbors, the local events you attend, the people you see around you daily. Secondly, a community composed of like-minded people that you specifically seek out: an education community, whether that means unschooling, homeschooling, school, or something else; people who share your political beliefs: people who share a specific interest or passion; a religious or spiritual community… And thirdly, community based on personal identity: sexual orientation, gender identity, racial identity, physical

The fastest-growing job market nationally was Houston, according to the study, with a 3.7 percent increase. It was followed by Atlanta (up 3.1 percent), Denver (up 2.5 percent), Dallas (up 2.4 percent) and Seattle.
According to an Oxford University professor who has seen her original manuscripts, Jane Austen was shit at grammar and crap at spelling. I happen to think she wrote dull novels as well (apart from Emma). Others disagree with me on that. But she is an example that great writers are about ideas not linguistic rules.

Music also plays a critical role, Emos like guitar-based rock with emotional lyrics – bands such as My Chemical Romance, Jimmy Eat World, and Dashboard Confessional are particular favourites.

I read the rest of the piece and it turns out that the wordplay gods did not rule in Sierra’s favor today. I’m pretty sure she did, in fact, mean to type “voila”, for which, entertainingly enough, the Wiktionary, an open-content dictionary, offers synonymous interjections such as, “Lo! There it is”, “ta-da” and “presto”.
She turned. She felt her stomach heaving a barely audible cry out of her throat. He walked in front of her, barely daring to hold her shoulders while facing her. She looked up, squaring her shoulders. She laughed.
But if we're going to point out flaws in '94 UD, I need to know what ever possessed Upper Deck to put that squashed mini version of the main photo in the bottom left corner. What a pointless design element. The black-and-white photo is barely legible in some of the horizontal cards.
Eventually gravity had her way and head relaxed completely as well.

The actual game itself was pretty infuriating though, because the referees were making INSANE calls. They’d throw my boys in the penalty box (especially Franzen) for the slightest offense, but then pretend not to see blatant tripping and holding from Nashville. I know what you’re saying: Oh, she just wanted her team to win. But the calls got so obnoxiously biased that by the beginning of the third period, the entire arena booed the refs when they came on the ice. Ouch.

not only does Jesus come down from heaven, live without sin, dies for our sin, rises as our saviour, ascends into heaven, and He opens a doorway into the presence of God and the Kingdom of God and invites us to come through it, by trusting in Him. Jesus is exclusive. not all religions save, not all paths lead to eternal life, not all religions are true. there is no salvation and no forgiveness of sins, no reconciliation with God, apart from faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus is exclusive and inclusive. He invites us ALL. no matter what sin you’ve committed, Jesus invites you. no matter what race you are, Jesus invites you. no matter how old you are, jesus invites you. no matter what you’ve believed up to now, Jesus invites you. the door is open. one door. His name is Jesus Christ. everyone is welcome to pass through THAT door. all nations, all genders, all ages, all peoples.
And it goes further… after the sad, senseless loss of a young friend, killed in Afghanistan, something we are still coming to terms with, after his funeral, we have once more realised how intertwined our lives all are, how we can touch the lives of many, some we do not even know… especially nowadays, with internet, phones AND the wonderful medium that is PHOTOGRAPHY! Many people can be touched by an image, we heard again...
